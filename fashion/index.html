<p>ADIDAS ORIGINALS ENFORCER MID SNAKESKIN</p>

<p>Priding itself on being one of the first brands to introduce animal prints onto sneakers, adidas chose to replicate its classic ‘90s basketball sneaker with one of the early animal hides to be featured on athletic footwear. The model itself boasts a clean design with a full wrap-around Velcro strap at its ankle, two-color rubber sole, perforated toebox and a padded tongue. For this collection, each Enforcer is made over with a snakeskin leather, in brown or black, with suede overlays and smooth leather accents.</p>

<p>ADDICT X RICHARD KERN ARTIST CO-LAB SERIES</p>

<p>UK-based streetwear mainstay Addict continues its NSFW photographic series of guest artist-designed tees, this time linking up with renowned New York-based photographer and filmmaker Richard Kern. Featuring two portraits of pot-smoking females from Kern’s most recent book Contact High, the tees see Kern once again playing with the “reliance upon taxonomies around sexual representation”, long a central theme of his work.</p>

<p>NIKE FREE HYPERFEEL TRAIL</p>

<p>Featuring a slightly higher cut and eschewing the original Hyperfeel’s Flyknit upper in favor of a more durable mesh slip-on with a synthetic mudguard overlay, the Hyperfeel Trail once again utilizes a drop-in Lunarlon/Free hybrid midsole in conjunction with an outdoor-specific waffle tread outsole. Dynamic Flywire is strategically placed throughout the upper for additional support and is notable in that its placement means tying the laces at the heel instead of the tongue area. Available in three colorways.</p>

<p>Highlight include GENERATION 27 which nods to the popular notion of the 27-hour day, variously said to be the number of hours it takes a man to do what a women accomplishes in 24, or the extra-long day a woman creates by doing several things at once. Urban legend also has it that 27 is in fact a reference to the exclusive - 27 Club, whose membership is apparently limited to musicians who have died at the age of 27, among them Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse. </p>

<p>OBEY x COPE2 COLLABORATION</p>

<p>I first got in touch with COPE2 because he had painted on a skateboard that ended up in a show in our gallery. I said, "Wow, COPE2….that guy's work is everywhere but I've never met him, I don't even know anyone who knows him. Do you have his email?" The guy that organized the skateboard show had the contact info, so I emailed him. COPE was super cool and said he knew my work well.</p>

<p>He said he would love to link up sometime when I was in New York, so yeah it somehow happened.. by modern technology. We ended up becoming friends and collaborating on a couple of walls. He took me up to the Bronx and we worked on a wall there on a production he's maintained for many years. He also took me out to do some bombing and hit some freeway spots. I simultaneously was doing a wall down in Manhattan that I had permission for, a really high-profile wall and told COPE2 he should get up on either end of this wall too. We showed a little uptown/downtown love, and mutual appreciation. We liked the way the production in the Bronx came out so much that we decided on a poster collaboration.</p>

<p>Martha Cooper, who is one of the all-time great graffiti photographers, shot the photo. So between me, COPE2, and Martha, it was a pretty epic collaboration. We talked about doing something with the Obey clothing line with COPE2. His work is great and he can pretty much do tags on top of anything, so we decided to let him do his thing on top of the OBEY icon, to also create a shirt of our Bronx collaboration. We have some great stuff coming out, and I'm always about putting the spotlight on people that I think have really put a lot of work in the culture and have earned the respect that they deserve. COPE2 is one of those people.</p>

<p>NUDIE FOOTWEAR</p>

<p>Working with fellow Swedes KAVAT, the Scandinavian partnership starts off simple with two models. Firstly, the Majorna, a chunky take on the desert boots, Nudie apply their green credentials to this shoe with its ecologic leather free from chrome and other nasty substances. Second up, the Hisingen, a sturdy Chelsea boot, reinforced at the front and back with plenty of grip.</p>

<p>The leather itself comes with a bit of a back story. Rather than wandering off to Italy or Spain for their hide, Nudie develop a traditional Swedish Smorläder, leather tanned with plenty of fat to withstand moisture and develop an unique patina, a traditional method from a country with a strong history of producing top quality leathers.</p>

<p>SAINT LAURENT AVENUE MONTAIGNE STORE</p>

<p>Under the creative direction of Hedi Slimane, the 900 m2 store is a physical embodiment of the brand’s realigned visual identity. An emphasis on rich, noble materials, generous proportions and architectural clarity as well as a preference for simplicity
over elaborate decoration bestows an air of serene, contemporary luxury and evokes the works and philosophies of the Union des Artistes Modernes (UAM).</p>

<p>Situated over two floors, the new store architecture and design is a modernist transposition of French Art Deco techniques and materials. The predominantly monochrome space exploits generous slabs of the finest ‘noir soie’ and
‘blanc statuaire’ marble set in opposition to board formed concrete walls. Silver and gold is found in 1930’s mirrored vitrines, with nickel-plated and mirror polished brass, atop a minimal concrete flooring. Stark contrasts in mood and atmosphere are created through the employment of dark sensual quilted leather upholstery
paired with extra-clear glass and mirrors while suspended hangbars in nickel-plated brass and minimalist marble display
podiums form elegant counterpoints to the flat surfaces.
Decoration is derived from the materials themselves. The natural veining in the marble and the concrete walls allow the architecture to retain a purity of form and a geometric rigor.</p>

<p>FRED PERRY X CHRISTOPHER RAEBURN</p>

<p>For Spring/Summer 2013 Fred Perry has announced a new Blank Canvas Capsule Collection with British designer Christopher Raeburn. Known for his heavy military inspiration in all of his designs, it comes without any surprise that the Fred Perry x Christopher Raeburn Blank Canvas line uses various camouflage patterns.</p>

<p>The American Issue Desert camouflage was specifically designed as an interference pattern for use during the early 90s, one that would interrupt the pixelated images of first generation night vision services. . The Schneetarn East German camouflage also known as ‘snowy pines’ is an unusual two-colour winter camouflage developed by a mountain warfare school first trialled in the 60s. Finally, the German Raindrop camouflage is a strong graphic reference from the 60s and 70s, less effective as an actual camouflage because at close range the colours would blend together.</p>

<p>All shirts feature tipping on the collar, in military green and orange plus an original surplus fabric woven patch pocket with a Fred Perry and Christopher Raeburn embroidery.</p>

<p>Born Jesus Christ Allin, G.G. Allin has been cited as “the most spectacular degenerate in rock &amp; roll history.”</p>

<p>Famously depicted in Todd Phillips’ documentary “Hated,” G.G. Allin’s controversial transgressions as a musician and live performer are notorious. No artist before, or after, has come close to comparing.</p>

<p>In commemoration of the 20th anniversary of G.G. Allin’s death in 1993, Merle Allin - brother and founding member of “The Murder Junkies,” allowed Altamont access to drawings G.G. made during his time in prison, as well as never-before-seen photographs. Merle chose his favorite images for a series of Altamont tees celebrating G.G. Allin’s extraordinary life.</p>

<p>G.G. Allin is Cut From a Different Cloth.</p>

<p>For their latest Spring/Summer collection, Fred Perry once again digged deep into the vaults of British subculture, taking inspiration from the early 80s graphic movement, when art directors such as Peter Saville and Neville Brody were making a profound impact on the decade, eventually shaping its distinct look and feel.</p>

<p>The underlying theme manifests itself in the prevalent use of patterns, that playfully mirror the vibrance of the this amazing era. Stripes, dots and industrial knit prints add a textural depths to knits.</p>

<p>SUPRA X HARMONY KORINE X SPRING BREAKERS DONAVYN</p>

<p>Supra has teamed up with director Harmony Korine on the Spring Breakers Donavyn low top sneaker. Celebrating the releas of his upcoming Spring Breakers film starring Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, Rachel Korine, and James Franco.</p>

<p>The Spring Breakers Donavyn is a low top, redolent of a dress shoe, with a color story that, at first glance, is as bizarre as some of Harmony’s scripts. But the hot pink and turquoise color story was chosen as a nod to another ubiquitous Florida institution, the hit 80's TV show Miami Vice. The upper is constructed from a unique, hot pink leather that looks shiny and wet like patent leather, but is actually a premium full-grain leather that technology has only recently been able to furnish with these kinds of extreme hues and textures - this is one of the first shoes in the world to feature this new material. It also has three pairs of laces (black, hot pink, and turquoise), a padded black mesh lining, and it’s constructed on a bright turquoise vulcanized sole with a double layer of turquoise foxing. Only 100 pairs of the Spring Breakers Donavyn were created.</p>

<p>ADIDAS CONSORTIUM X HANON CNTR</p>

<p>For this release Hanon pay tribute to their hometown of Aberdeen - The Granite City! 
Both the colour way and material application are inspired by the surroundings which were historically built from locally quarried granite. 
Executed in suede, mesh and nubuck, the grey upper of the Centaur depicts the seasonal change of Aberdeen’s granite landscape. At the rear of the shoe there is a dark grey suede with a heavy nap representing the gloom of winter which is offset by a dual layered silver mesh and light grey nubuck that leans towards the fairer months of the year.
Additional features appear by way of red accents, granite three stripes and multi print sock liner. The detail on the stripes was created by applying a mirror image print of the grain on the stonework at our warehouse to a black 3M reflective material, while the footbed and tongue backer draws inspiration from adidas’ archive boxes and tissue paper.</p>

<p>Further detail on the shoe appears in the form of dual branding via debossed heel tabs and embroidered Consortium tongue pulls. The hanon flame appears on the left shoe whilst the adidas Trefoil is applied on the right. Each hanon Centaur comes with silver foil footbed labels, three sets of laces - one tonal, one contrast and one with a reflective weave.
A limited edition dust bag will be released with a number of pairs of the shoe and 50 pcs of a special edition ‘granite’ tshirt will accompany the shoe for the instore launch only.</p>

<p>The new collaboration is the latest in the brand’s popular Affili’Art program, which has produced collections with the likes of Jean-Michel Basquiat and Ryan McGinness and sees Reebok Classic working with Haring’s well-known icons, the antic Everyman, Barking Dog and Radiant Baby and for the first time, a range of interpretations of unique paintings and drawings, to present a collection that fuses fashion and art and embodies the individuality of this remarkable artist.</p>

<p>The distinctive collection features much-loved Reebok Classic silhouettes, the Classic Leather, Classic Leather Mid, NPC II, Workout Plus and Freestyle, that were first introduced during the 1980s, around the same time as some of Haring’s most acclaimed work.</p>

<p>AKOMPLICE X RICKY POWELL HAT COLLECTION</p>

<p>The collection is comprised of pom beanies in black and red as well as a trio of snap backs in hunter green, maroon and navy. Each hat features our logo alongside Ricky's signature and the number 50 illuminating the inclusion of this collection within Ricky's 50th anniversary.</p>

<p>More than a collection of hats, this is a collaborative effort which will reverberate with New Yorkers. For the collection we made use of the iconic New York Times typeface and added our own street savvy spin. In line with Ricky's artistic appetite, we enlisted a threesome of topless models who were more than willing to bare their bodies for Ricky's lens. Along with the digital look book, a curated collection of physical prints will be on display at our flagship Saturday, November 17th with Ricky Powell in attendance. We will be offering a pre-release of the hats the night of the event. The hats will be available at fine Akomplice retailers worldwide on November 26th.</p>

<p>Basketball culture had its golden times in the ‘80s and ‘90s with adidas playing an integral role in the scene, offering a range of impressive court footwear such as the popular Metro Attitude and Conductor. In 1986, the Rivalry was released as a very close relation to the Conductor and came in a huge array of color combinations. The original colorway paid tribute to one of New York City’s top basketball teams at the time, the reason every New York fan had to have their hands on a pair.</p>

<p>For Consortium, adidas Originals brings back the Rivalry Lo in a nostalgic move with two colorways: the iconic OG of white, blue and orange is matched up alongside rival Chicago team colors in black, red and white. The reissue is upgraded with the quality materials that Consortium is known for.</p>

<p>The adidas Originals Consortium Rivalry Lo Pack will only be available at No.6 London, No.74 Berlin and Consortium retailers from November 23, 2012.</p>

<p>ADIDAS ORIGINALS - CONSORTIUM SS12 - YOUR STORY</p>

<p>When adidas Originals brought Consortium back for FW11, the slate was wiped clean giving a fresh start to the premium range. It also paved the way for the next collection as they invited nine creative partners to fill in the canvas.<br>Here's drop one.<br></p>

<p>BC X Kate Moross (opposite) - Her distinctive style has her partnering up adidas Originals to interpret the BC, paying homage to the Olympics in her own graphic way.</p>

<p>Decade Hi X Aloe Blacc (opposite) - The ox blood premium leather is suggestive of African soil while the translucent gum outsole represents the bare foot of Blacc's inspiration, Ethiopian gold medalist and marathon runner Abebe Bikila, who competed in the 1960 Olympics held in Rome.</p>

<p>Pro Shell X MURO - MURO's Pro Shell is understated, but bursts of detail are found throughout, like the jersey material covering the ankle padding that features engineered stripes reminiscent of a track top's cuff.</p>

<p>ZX 500 X Quote - Quote's muted colour-way is directly influenced by the blue and white track of the Berlin Olympic Stadium.</p>

<p>Matchplay X J. Thompson - Thompson looked back to the adidas archives of track and field shoes from the '30s as inspiration, and has used very subtle waxed leather on most of the upper which gives it a vintage look. A matching pigskin suede toebox shows impeccable attention to detail while the lack of lining gives it a handcrafted feel.</p>

<p>PUMA BOLT LITE LOW &amp; BOLT LITE MID</p>

<p>For Summer 2012 Puma releases two new sneakers, fusing the past and the future. The Puma Suede and Suede Mid are brought into the future this season in the form of the Bolt Lite Low and Bolt Lite Mid.</p>

<p>Inspired by Usain Bolt, Puma added new outer soles to the sneakers that are close to their Faas soles in terms of technology. Made of the same material as the Faas soles, they also tried to stay true to the Suede and thus kept the original form of the Suede outer sole. The outcome is quite impressive - old school sneakers with new school technology.<br>The low top only weighs 144 grams and the mid top 176 grams.</p>

<p>CARHARTT X 5BORO NYC COLLECTION</p>

<p>“The 5BORO NYC and Carhartt W.I.P. crew skated and documented their way from the founding city of 5boro, “The Big Apple” to the founding city of Carhartt, “Motor City”. Carhartt’s Pontus Alv and 5boro’s Mark Nardelli worked together laying out Pontus’ sketches and photos to create the collection, officializing this collaboration with a distinct Carhartt-colored, co-branded labeling system.</p>

<p>"Carhartt loves skateboarding and so does 5boro. Sure Carhartt W.I.P. is primarily a European thing – and 5boro owns a big part of its existence to the New York City roots it so greatly takes pride in – but the truth is that this geographical and cultural difference is quite easily overshadowed by what both do have in common: A genuine love for skateboarding, and a certain way to go about it. <br>
Both Carhartt and 5boro embrace all aspects of skateboarding, with teams consisting of a wide variety of skaters, on the board and off. When 5boro offered Carhartt team member Pontus Alv a guest board the ball started rolling and a while later flights were already being booked. Once everybody got in the van together it was only a matter of time for things to fall into place, by the time we left for Detroit both crews had pretty much blended together. After coming back to NYC, Pontus and 5boro’s art director Mark Nardelli got together and sealed the deal on our newfound alliance by designing these Carhartt X 5boro items.”</p>

<p>HERITAGE RESEARCH VC  JACKET - COGGLES EXCLUSIVE</p>

<p>Heritage Research - VC, mens lightweight black Hawaiian printed Japanese cotton jacket, made exclusively for Coggles. The jacket features a single chest pocket, button front and two hip pockets. Internally the jacket is fully lined with a single chest pocket.</p>

<p>Heritage Research clothing has been compiled for those who desire an authentic garment from a specific period but want a contemporary cut and aesthetic. That is, a garment which in design, components, and quality matches the original garment but can be assimilated into a modern wardrobe.</p>

<p>The nostalgia behind these styles is what makes them attractive. They were born out of a time of necessity, designed for a specific purpose - to function and protect under adverse and challenging conditions. Since then they have become timeless fashion items, appealing to a rugged utilitarian image. Attention to authenticity, quality and history is the Heritage Research ethos.</p>

<p>STARCOW X REEBOK 25TH ANNIVERSARY</p>

<p>New Reebok collaboration with Parisian boutique Starcow. Inspired by the city of Paris and their passion for skateboarding, the outcome is rather simple looking version of the low top sneaker, yet packed with some great features at a closer look.<br>
 “We wanted to propose a classic take on the Reebok Workout shoe. With an upper as grey as the Parisian rooftops &amp; the streets that we skate. Orange as an honor to the classic gum soles.
Since we have our heart in skate culture, maybe it wasn’t a coincidence that the shoe ended up looking something like a skate shoe…
For the materials we wanted something more technical; water-resistant suede for the upper, Thinsulate™ lining &amp; an inner sole with cushion. Easy on the looks but performing for the user.”</p>

<p>The Starcow x Reebok Workout Low Plus 25th Anniversary will release along with the other retail collaborations on February 15th, 2012.</p>

<p>LDRS1354 X ADIDAS FORUM MOCCASIN MID</p>

<p>Last November, Leaders 1354 were given the task of making the Adidas Forum their own. The first permanent settlers in Chicago were the Potawatomi, so they took the Forum and mixed in a Native American theme with it. With that theme comes a few new twists to the Fourm: moccasin fringe on the heel (that’s also removable), zig zag stitches, and premium leather laces. These will be available Saturday Dec. 17th in store and their webstore.</p>

<p>YOHJI YAMAMOTO - THIS IS MY DREAM</p>

<p>Notoriously private Japanese fashion design icon Yohji Yamamoto lets his guard down in an exclusive, intimate short documentary film about life and the creative process, from Tokyo to New York.</p>

<p>A perfect emblem of Yamamoto’s drive for innovation, the Y-3 label -one of eight distinctive lines the designer oversees- has created a new category in fashion since its introduction in 2002. Born out of a desire to merge Yamamoto’s craftsmanship with adidas’ technical prowess, Y-3 has come to be recognized as the future of sportswear, and it is the backdrop against which the film unfolds.</p>

<p>The documentary tracks Yohji Yamamoto and the global team working on the collection, casting, styling, show production, PR and communication for a short period of time during the Summer and early Autumn of 2009. Beginning with the finalization of the collection and styling for the show in Tokyo, followed by his arrival in New York City to oversee the final touches for the presentation of Y-3’s Spring/Summer 2010 collection, the documentary turns an intimate eye on Yamamoto during fittings, model castings, guitar-playing, philosophical musings, and interactions with his staff and the global team bringing his ideas to life.</p>

<p>ADIDAS OBYO JEREMY SCOTT 2NE1 JS WINGS</p>

<p>ADAM KIMMEL X CARHARTT FALL/WINTER 2011</p>

<p>Adam Kimmel has fused some of his favorite colors and styles with the manufacturing and looks of heritage workwear brand Carhartt in this collection. We love the details and especially the dark blue tone that the designer exported into the line. The plaid lined denim shirts and cashmere beanies are also solid items. The classic Adam Kimmel blazer, this time produced by Carhartt is probably the best bet in the collection and something that should not be missed.</p>

<p>FRED PERRY ORIGAMI BLANK CANVAS</p>

<p>The Fred Perry Origami Blank Canvas was developed after it was discovered that there is a subculture of artists in Japan that specialise in ‘fashion origami’ with a large focus being on the polo shirt. Fred Perry began investigating the paper conventionally used within the Japanese art form and found that traditional patterns were regularly used.  Three of these have been injected into the Blank Canvas range as prints on the shirts, and include the cherry blossom, polka dot and fans.</p>

The campaign imagery was filmed and all of the print images are still captures from the video footage.</p>

<p>A bit of a retrospect on this “new” Fred Perry collection which works with the very best in U.K. heritage clothing lines. “Liberty is, of course, a British institution, with their art fabrics being used by everyone from Dior to Gucci, so they were an obvious choice to provide the fabrics. Smyth &amp; Gibson of Belfast have been hand making luxury shirts for more than two decades.</p>

<p>The End product is three beautifully construction shirts, each with meticulous attention to detail. The styles echo both Liberty’s and Fred Perry’s heritage, using both oxford cloth and Liberty Art Fabrics to great effect. [They] have also worked with Guernsey Woollens to produce a Limited edition traditional Guernsey Sweater.</p>

“Workwear could be found in all of my collections—like the jumpsuit which was inspired in part by the uniform of painters and mechanics. And as I said durability and wearability are also big staples of mine. I’ve always appreciated clothes that you can wear everyday, and I think both my brand and Carhartt supply that. While the AK product is handmade in Italy using very high-end fabric, the Adam Kimmel/Carhartt collection is made in Carhartt workwear facilities. The price point will be somewhere between Carhatt’s and my own.”</p>

<p>BURTON X TRON - LEGACY SNOWBOARD BOOT</p>

<p>“The exclusive new TRON: Legacy model, part of the all-new Burton Raptor boot line, blends best-in-class tech with an aesthetic that mirrors the high-tech world of TRON. Inspired by the film’s strong graphic look and feel, the boot is made to look like something out of the future, but seen through the eyes of a snowboarder back in 1982 when the original TRON film was released. A holographic treatment on the upper boot brings the futuristic feel to life, backed by electric orange and aqua color blocking and linear detailing taken right from the images of TRON: Legacy. In addition, the boot features both Burton and TRON: Legacy branding on its exterior.</p>

<p>The ‘Remodel’ Top Ten takes the timeless st yling of the original
silhouett e and imbues it with a contemporary twist through the
use of modern production techniques and cutt ing edge materials.
The result is an updated take that raises the bar in terms of comfortable,lightweight durability.</p>

<p>Featuring a slighter slimmer profile as well as a re-worked
midsole and less padding on the ankle collar, everything on the shoe
feels a little more st ripped back.
The upper is constructed from a combination of premium leather
and a soft, pliable fine gauge mesh that sits well with the reinterpretation
of the model.
The black 3-Stripes pop out in a contrast ing welded on TPU , while
the top 3 lace holes are replaced with a one-piece eyelet system that
further contributes to the contemporary feel of the Top Ten Remodel.
Finished with an updated ‘Top Ten’ graphical tongue tag that plays
on the baller heritage of the silhouette, this is a re-edit of an icon
that’s not to be missed.</p>

<p>A.P.C. + CARHARTT</p>

<p>"Carhartt is in many ways the epitomy of the endless golden west, so brilliantly portrayed by Woody Guthrie, and which has been with us for so long. Wandering towards glory, a journey which is to take you away forever, and lonely teardrops will be shed along the path.</p>

<p>Pioneer spirit, gold digger... to tell you the truth, I have never thought much of these myths, and I find them somewhat nauseating. Nevertheless, its uniform has always meant hitting home base for A.P.C.. I have always tried to emulate this viewpoint that, when convenience is really to the point, the outcome is genuinely beautiful.</p>

<p>Therefore, a collaboration between Carhartt and A.P.C. was clearly the thing to do.</p>

<p>Work clothes are pretty good at leading a life of their own: they’ll ramble on, talking to themselves in your wardrobe, and will always be there for you. It is also true that they speak louder once worn, dirtied, soiled, washed and dried in the open air.</p>

<p>ADIDAS ORIGINALS OT TECH HIKE BOOT</p>

<p>Another colorway of the adidas Originals OT Tech Hike Spezial Boot, which is first being introduced for Fall 2010. We actually prefer this one, over the first black colorway. Beige and navy work really well together, also the color accents on the mid-sole are great. If we had to complain, we would love for the large size trefoil logo on the side not to be there actually. Otherwise a clean looking boot.</p>

<p>When asked about his activity on U-stream and Twitter:
'U-Stream is a great way for artists to connect with their fans, and witness un-staged, un-scripted moments. Its sites like that where they decide what it is they like about you personally, aside from the music. '</p>

<p>When asked which London designers he had his eye on:
'All of 'em. '</p>

<p>When asked about his pre-stage rituals:
'I have a big cup of tea and relax. I'm big on herbal tea. '</p>

<p>When asked to give women some advice on men (the piece de resistance):
'Women go wrong because they don't understand that the basis of a relationship is friendship. A woman should act like a lady. If you're chilling with your buds playing video games she should know to stay out of the room until you've finished. Unless she's bringing you drinks.'</p>

<p>Adidas X Exit Exclusive:
'I'm writing my own movie called A Woman's Touch. It's about all the women who have made an impact on my life; my mother, my daughter and my wife. '</p>

The collection consists of three meticulously handcrafted jackets designed by Berry that embody the elements of classic punk rock and undeniably illustrate the mutual respect and understanding the designers have for one another.</p>

<p>Berry approached each of these designs as 3 dimensional painting, giving each piece its own unique pallet, hand studding, hand distressing and hand pulled silk screens. The jackets took about 35 to 40 man-hours each to create, all done buy hand. And it is rumored that one of the jackets has already sold for $10,000!”</p>

<p>SOMERSET HOUSE</p>

<p>A major exhibition celebrating 20 years of one of contemporary fashion's most influential and enigmatic designers. This ambitious, multi-layered exhibition captured Margiela's unique aesthetic and vision, incorporating garments, installations, photography and film. This exhibition was initiated by the Fashion Museum Province of Antwerp and Maison Martin Margiela.</p>

<p>Young as its history is, no other fashion house has had quite the same impact on our understanding of fashion and its relationship to history, craft, commerce and innovation.

<p>ACNE FURNITURE</p>

<p>ACNE’s Jonny Johanssen presents the new collection of furniture in the latest addition to the sick Acne line. In Mr. Johanssen’s own words, ”The Nya Berlin was an archetypical piece of Malmsten design and was created for use in the Swedish consulate in Berlin. It has not been in production since 1949, so it was really inspiring to work with. With this sofa as a reference, I started to look at how we worked architecturally, instead of just treating say the upholstery. I decided as an alternative to objectify its form from a perspective play. As we do with fashion we played with proportion, lineage and structure – stretching, squashing and pulling the simplistic shape to create new sculptural forms.</p>

<p>Pringle of Scotland has commissioned Glasgow-based artist David Shrigley to produce a corporate film. The 3-minute animation depicts the making of jumpers and cardigans over the past nearly 200 year history of the Scottish brand. Shrigley has used his artistic strategy of dead-pan wit and dark humour to narrate how jumpers are made today. His anarchic voice is ever present throughout the film as he draws the wonderful portray of an odd and insane fashion world.</p>

<p>HERALD HIGH DERBY</p>

<p>The Louis Vuitton Herald High Derby is one of our favorite silhouettes in their Summer 2010 Collection. The desert boot by the French luxury brand is made of suede calf leather and features a natural leather strip on the back and tag on the tongue. The desert boot is nothing new and we still love the original by Clarks, but Louis Vuitton definitely takes it to the next level with these. The quality, soft choice of colors and details are perfect on these, making sure that they keep their subtle looks, yet adding a real premium touch to it.</p>

<p>The third collaboration between adidas Originals and graffiti artist FAFI is now available online at colette. As previously mentioned, the graphics featured on Stan Smith and Honey Mid this time are based on FAFI’s next comic book which details her trots around the globe and sense of style. Something to take note of — while the Stan Smith highlights bits and pieces of drawings, the Honey Mid’s graphics are actually done up in style of comic strips, so do take some extra time to admire what’s going on behind the shoes.</p>

<p>POLO RALPH LAUREN QUILTED</p>

<p>Barbour-style quilted jackets are pretty big in the UK at the moment. It’s a style of jacket that can easily go wrong, but done right it can be a great look. The problem with some of the new Barbour items is that they’re starting to feature their name more prominently - which is a turn off for those who like their style to be anonymous. This Ralph Lauren jacket has no such problems as the only labels are on the inside and we love it.</p>

<p>CAMPER TOGETHER WITH BERNHARD WILLHELM</p>

<p>The new To &amp; Ether collection from Camper, points directly at the avant-garde of alternative fashion.  The unique signature of Bernhard Willhelm, the outstanding disciple of the prestigious school in Antwerp and the same school that in the 80´s formed talents like Dries Van Noten, Ann Demeulemeester, Dirk Bikkembergs, Dirk Van Saene and Martin Margiela (the generation known as the “Antwerp six”).</p>

<p>Willhelm has designed shoe collections for both men and women. Moccasins and sandals fabricated with handcrafted techniques and recycled materials, hand sewn, coloured felts with rubber soles. The innovation is also illustrated simply, with actual traits of common sense.  “I wanted to apply ethical and ecological criteria in the making of this shoe collection.  I would like people to keep these criteria in mind when they are choosing a shoe”.  Willhelm’s designs are added to those that Jaime Hayon, Alfredo Häberli and Maria Blaisse have developed “together” within Camper’s new creative adventure.</p>

By bringing together a handpicked crop of 12 global retail figureheads, all given full freedom to do whatever they want with 5 iconic 3-Striped silhouettes as 3 unique groups, adidas have entrusted their valued Consortium partners to share their unique vision collectively, using a ‘Work Amongst Yourselves’ brief.

Patta, Alife, Limited Editions and Sneakers’n’stuff make up the first group, Goodfoot, Undefeated, DQM and Huf make up the second, with the trio completed by the formation of ACU, D-Mop, Crooked Tongues and VA.</p>

<p>The first wave of 3-Way Consortium releases from adidas Originals unites three of Europe’s leading sneaker boutiques - Patta, Sneakersnstuff and LimitEditions, representing Amsterdam, Stockholm and Barcelona respectively, with New York’s A.R.C. Opting to rework a shoe each in their own unique style, all four join forces for a fifth shoe that reflects the best of all involved.

<p>MULBERRY ELIOT HOLDALL</p>

<p>Recently we've seen a growing amount of faux leather holdalls making their way onto the high-end market. It’s not a movement we endorse, as faux leather looks and feels terrible in comparison to the real thing. These Mulberry holdalls use heavy grain leather which beautifully ages with wear, leaving a bag that looks better the more you use it. It’s also the perfect size for airport hand luggage restrictions and thus makes a chic and stylish travel bag.</p>

<p>PAUL SMITH MILLER BROGUE</p>

<p>We're very big fans of Paul Smith at Exit  and we love these trademark Miller brogues that have been available in various hues for several seasons now and Smith’s SS09 collection looks to carry on the tradition. Miller is Paul Smith Mainline leather gentlemen’s brogue with sky blue dip dyed washed uppers. They are crafted on a classic Oxford brogue pattern, on a slim fashion last. The soles are trimmed right to the edge of the upper to give a more casual look. <BR>Part of the Dip-Dye range, the uppers of these shoes have been immersed in dyes and tumbled in large wooden drums to dye the upper leather, the lining and the stitching for intense colour. These brogues feature fabric window inserts on the inside lining and painted check insoles. The soles themselves are made with Blake Rapid construction and the bases have been hand painted and hammered.</p>

<p>NOWHERE AT DOVER STREET MARKET</p>

<p>15 years ago friends and collaborators Nigo (A Bathing Ape) and Jun Takahashi (Undercover) opened a tiny shop in Harajuku Tokyo called NOWHERE. It was Undercover's first ever dedicated retail space. The space also had Nigo's picks of US vintage wear. During that first year Nigo also launched A Bathing Ape in NOWHERE.
For Spring 2009 Nowhere have created a shop-in-shop at Dover Street Market. The London store, operated by Comme des Garcons, recreated the original store front of the Nowhere store.
NOWHERE is now open for a limited period of time in the Basement of DSM  selling A Bathing Ape products and exclusive products made by Nigo and Jun together under the NOWHERE name.</p>
