<p>MARK COHEN - DARK KNEES (1969 - 2012)</p>

<p>Over the past 40 years Mark Cohen has walked the length and breadth of the streets in and around his hometown, seizing - or rather extracting - fragments of gestures, postures and bodies. In his photos we see headless torsos, smiling children, willing subjects yet still frighteningly vulnerable, thinly sketched limbs and coats worn like protective cloaks. Thus Mark Cohen slices and sculpts the very thick of the world to impose, in successive touches, a Kafkaesque vision, ruthless and poetic, of an environment that encompasses him. A vision from within.</p>

<p>This remarkable body of work - Cohen rarely uses the viewfinder, holding the camera at arm's length - is rooted in impulsions that last just fractions of a second. A disconcerting strangeness emanates from his subjects, some caught in the dazzle of the flash. Bodies seem uncomfortable, threatened, lost, grinning too wildly or reduced to their erotic dimension. Ordinary objects appear isolated, mysterious, sinister. The decline of this small mining town is right there, in its yards, at its bus stops, on its porches, but Mark Cohen's intentions are anything but documentary. Repetitive to the verge of obsession, he has no idea what brought him there or what he hopes to find. Rather he is driven by the beauty of a chance encounter, by the torments or delights he detects in another's substance.</p>

<p>There is, in the brutality of his gaze, a rawness and a nervous energy, an ambivalence and a grace through which the making of a photo becomes the expression of a revelation.</p>

<p>CORINNE DAY - MAY THE CIRCLE REMAIN UNBROKEN</p>

<p>A young man in a yellow crocheted bikini talks on the phone, a woman wearing only a lampshade kneels on the floor and another man uses chips for fangs. Filled with humour and life where one can almost hear the laughter out of shot, these images of Kevin, Tara, Vinca and George form part of an exhibition of previously unseen photographs of early work by Corinne Day.</p>

<p>May the Circle Remain Unbroken shows the people that Corinne's work brought together and the friendships that formed over 20 years ago and continue to endure three years after her passing. It also illuminates Day's pioneering approach to photography where the boundaries are blurred to the extent that it is impossible to dissect the constructed from real. Corinne and long term partner Mark Szaszy's Brewer Street flat often doubled as a set where friends, models and muses all overlapped. In addition to the photographs, a series of music videos by Mark will be screened bringing to life the protagonists in Day's work.</p>

<p>Accompanying the exhibition is a new publication of the same name by Morel Books. Edited by Mark Szaszy, this book documents Corinne's progress from the early to mid nineties and stands as the first work since Diary.</p>

<p>TYLER SHIELDS - SUBMERGED</p>

<p>The gallery will exhibit a variety of never before seen images of Young Hollywood’s elite featuring stars like Lydia Hearst and Connor Paolo in a unique series entitled ‘Submerged’. The gripping underwater series was photographed at various sub aqua locations – from the sea and Grand Canyon lakes to the lowly bathtub. It took six months to complete, and was chosen as a theme by Tyler to really challenge himself and push his own boundaries.</p>

<p>The participants had to learn how to hold their breath underwater for as long as possible- Tyler being the longest at a whopping 4mins 30 secs! Morgan Peszko was second best excelling at 2mins 01secs. This made the shoot both difficult and excitingly dangerous. The girls wore giant ball gowns to really emphasise the flowing elegance underwater. These heavily weighed them down in the water, to the point that the girls wanted to burn the dresses when the shoot was over!</p>

<p>When asked what the inspiration was behind ‘Submerged’, Tyler said “Shooting underwater is very, very hard. This series is about showing my view of an underwater world. A lot of these photos look like they are taken in space. They feel other worldly. My goal was to create the most insane underwater series ever done.”</p>

<p>PATRICK LICHFIELD - CARIBBEAN</p>

<p>This is the first exhibition of Lichfield's Caribbean images, many unpublished, 
representing all genres of Lichfield’s photography: landscape, portraiture, fashion 
and nudes.</p>

<p>Patrick Lichfield (1939-2005) was an internationally renowned photographer who 
worked for all the major magazines. His pictures were exhibited worldwide, and he 
published several books during his career. The National Portrait Gallery dedicated a 
retrospective exhibition to the first twenty years of his work in 2002.!His great break was 
when he was summoned by Diana Vreeland, the doyenne of fashion editors, to photograph 
the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and he was given a five year contract with American 
Vogue. In 1981 he was appointed official photographer at the wedding of his cousin The 
Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer.!</p>

<p>EDWARD BURTYNSKY - WATER</p>

<p>The exhibition presents a selection of photographs from a much larger body of work that, along with the film Watermark and the Burtynsky - Water book (Steidl), are a result of Edward Burtynsky's largest project to date, documenting the scale and impact of manufacturing and consumption on the world's water supplies. Burtynsky chronicles the various roles that water plays in modern life – as a source of healthy ecosystems and energy, as a key element in cultural and religious rituals and as a rapidly depleting resource. The photographs, both beautiful and haunting, create a compelling global portrait that illustrates humanity's past, present and future relationship with the natural world.</p>

<p>Shooting in ten different countries for the Water project, Burtynsky's subjects include dry-land farming in Spain, pivot irrigation sites in Texas, and the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. In these instances, Burtynsky took to the air using conventional helicopters, remote controlled helicopters and small fixed-wing aircraft, to bring the scale of the human imprint into a more meaningful perspective. He also traveled to photograph millions of people bathing in the cleansing power of the sacred Ganges River in India; mega-dam construction on the upper Yangtze and the once-per-year silt release on the Yellow River in China, and the precious virgin watersheds of British Columbia and the dry beds of the Colorado River Delta.</p>

<p>DANCE OF THE SEVEN VEILS</p>

<p>Dance of the Seven Veils refers to the beheading of St. John the Baptist demanded by Salome. Interestingly, this tale has antecedents both in the Old Testament and in Assyrian and Babylonian religions, thus revealing a connection between the West and the Middle East, an undercurrent of the exhibition itself.</p>

<p>As the title suggests, it's all about the veil - a controversial topic not just in the Middle East, but also in the West. One need only think of the recent clash between Muslim protesters and riot police in a Paris suburb after attempts were made to fine a woman for wearing a full Islamic veil. Or one need only recall any number of incidents in the Middle East where so-called religious police beat women for not wearing the veil.</p>

<p>But the veil is just the tip of the iceberg. This article of clothing has become a symbol of women's rights - the right to drive, to education, to appear without a male relative in public, to work, to vote.... Paradoxically, the question of the veil reveals gender issues even as it conceals the female form.</p>

<p>Our mission is to be a catalyst for contemplation and a platform for artists of significant merit. Consistent with our commitment to relevancy and dialogue, we have chosen works for Dance of the Seven Veils which are both contemporary and provocative but which, in the final analysis, transcend their anecdotal and historical content. It is this quality of transcendence that distinguishes, for example, a photograph from a photographic work of art. When form overtakes content, craft becomes art, and timely becomes timeless. Or to put it another way, as a colleague art dealer once said, "Subject matter is only an excuse to make a great work of art."</p>

<p>DRAGANA JURISIC - YU: THE LOST COUNTRY</p>

<p>This series of photographs are the outcome of Dragana Jurisic's journey around the former Yugoslavia, retracing the route of an extraordinary expedition made by Anglo Irish writer Rebecca West in 1937 written about in the acclaimed book Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (1941). The final images capture unexpected and often uncanny parallels to West's text and delve into the artist's understanding of her own history.</p>

<p>At the centre of Dragana Jurisic's project lies the extraordinary travel book Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, written by Anglo Irish writer Rebecca West in 1937, charting her journey through Yugoslavia. The resulting work, initially intended as a snap book, spiralled into half a million words, and became a portrait not just of Yugoslavia, but of Europe on the brink of the Second World War.</p>

<p>West thought of Yugoslavia as her motherland. By its very nature Yugoslavia was a land of displaced peoples and this was a fate that Rebecca West shared. Born to an Anglo-Irish family, she never felt like she truly belonged anywhere. "In any class I feel at home, and I am never accepted, because of the traces I bear of my other origins." West said that she could only remember things if she was able to write them down and consequently wrote half a million words about a country she knew was to become a memory, in order not to forget anything about it, and to preserve this memory for millions of Yugoslavs who now live in exile. She thought of art as re-living of experience.</p>

<p>SIMEN JOHAN</p>

<p>New work from Simen Johan’s ongoing series of photographs and sculptures, Until the Kingdom Comes, which he began in 2005, depicts a natural world that is at once familiar and otherworldly.<br>Most, but not all, of the images are intricate digital constructs incorporating elements the artist photographed in various geographical locations. Towering giraffes, shot in various U.S. zoos, populate a hazy, desolate landscape created from images taken in Turkey, Bali and Iceland; spectacular Javan peacocks from Asia are camouflaged within a Spanish pepper tree; and the interior of an Icelandic volcano forms the setting for a gooey tar pit where Peruvian yellow-hooded blackbirds nest.</p>

<p>Each image confuses the boundaries between opposing forces such as the natural and the artificial, the beautiful and the eerie, the known and the unknown. These dynamic tensions reflect internal conflicts and contradictions inherent to human nature that fuel Johan’s work.</p>

<p>PHOTOGRAPHES BY JULIAN LENNON</p>

<p>Julian Lennon has always felt that he has observed life differently, perhaps because his 
path through life has been so unusual. Nothing could be more apparent, as he reveals to the 
viewer his keen eye for composition and his gift for capturing an intimate moment. 
Encouraged by the success of his first-ever exhibition of fine-art photography, Timeless, 
which took place in New York City in 2010, Julian seeks to depict his personal journey 
as an artist in the midst of unique life experiences.</p>

<p>Though primarily known as a singer-songwriter, musician and producer, Julian has grown 
to encompass many talents, including those of documentary film producer, philanthropist 
and, as of late, fine-art photographer. He has found a diverse base of fans around the 
world, engaged by both his world-view and artistic output.

<p>OLIVO BARBIERI - ALPS - GEOGRAPHIES AND PEOPLE</p>

<p>Having previously completed a series of aerial photographs in the Dolomites range in northern Italy, Barbieri has embarked on a project documenting the largest range in Europe, and the relationship that extreme climbers have to the terrain. As the artist describes:</p>

<p>"The subject of 'Alps – Geographies and People' is how the mountain is perceived from the climbers' point of view, its peaks and precipices, the mirages and hallucinations in its geography. In these images, everything is true. The proportions and the forms are real. Even the people and the position they're in...those, too, are real."</p>

<p>The word Alps derives from the French and Latin "alpes", which at one time was thought to derive from the Latin "albus" (white), in reference to the permanent snow on the peaks of the range. Employing a technique he calls "solid color", Barbieri makes erasures and selectively whites out portions of the mountains, opening the possibility to define their fundamental forms in a concise way. Conceptually similar to the selected focus of his site specific series, which transformed the world into a model of itself, Barbieri here uses "solid color" to draw out the mountain's basic, original form. Shot from a helicopter, the sublime and dizzying vantage is further enhanced by the inclusion of climbers traversing rocks and chasms, seeking to discover a hidden truth in what Barbieri describes as "blank maps", a kind of spiritual space outside the realm of traceable geography. Whereas his previous Dolomites series revealed the terrain and included people as a near supplemental element denoting scale, Alps - Geographies and People moves the climbers to the fore, presenting their extreme and dangerous traverse as a near hallucinogenic journey of discovery among the most famous heights of Europe's largest peaks.</p>

<p>MARC WILSON - THE LAST STAND</p>

<p>‘The Last Stand’, photographed by Marc Wilson since 2010, aims to reflect the histories, stories and memories of military conflict and the landscape. Awarded runner up in the Terry O’Neil Awards, the series of photographs have attracted wide spanning interest and have recently been featured on the BBC.</p>

<p>These compelling images have a captivating duality that challenges the placing of the series within any distinct context. On the one hand these photographs epitomise Wilson’s undeniable skill as a photographer. Having so far been photographed around the UK, Channel Islands, North France and Belgium on various strips of coastline, these abandoned and decaying structural defences, built for the brutality of war are intrinsically opposed to the rugged scenery surrounding them, giving Wilson’s images a powerful tension and evocative beauty. Wilson’s approach to the subject is purposefully subtle; “It was important that they didn’t look too bold or exciting; after all it’s not a bold and exciting subject. What they are is dark and historically important.” The ephemeral images are reminiscent of oil paintings depicting the sublime; visually engaging in their haunting beauty.</p>

<p>Whilst on the other, these photographs have become a crucial documentation of these historically important landmarks. Landmarks that are now in danger of erosion, decay and dismantling. ‘The Last Stand’ explores the current presence of these architectural defences and explores how through their ongoing decay they have entwined themselves historically and physically with the changing landscape.</p>

<p>GOPRO HERO3+</p>

<p>GoPro updates their line of action-ready cameras with the HERO3+, the successor to the brand’s HERO3. The flagship model, the Black Edition, is now 20% smaller and has an increased battery life of 30%. The company claims the images taken on the upgraded lens should be 33% sharper while featuring half the amount of digital artifacts. In addition, the camera’s sensor has been upgraded for better low-light performance, as has the wireless connectivity, resulting in up to four times faster connectivity.</p>

<p>PHILIP-LORCA DICORCIA - HUSTLERS</p>

<p>Taken just over twenty years ago in Los Angeles in the vicinity of Santa Monica Boulevard, it features male prostitutes posing for the camera for a fee loosely equivalent to what they would charge for their sexual services. DiCorcia paid the subjects with grant money awarded to him by the National Endowment for the Arts, a bold gesture during the controversial years that witnessed censorship of NEA-supported exhibitions by Robert Mapplethorpe, Andres Serrano, and other artists.</p>

<p>In 1993, twenty-one photographs were exhibited at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, marking diCorcia’s first museum solo exhibition. The show, entitled Strangers, was later accompanied by a museum publication. Two decades later, the exhibition at David Zwirner presents thirty-six photographs from the series, including twelve works newly produced and shown for the first time, and coincides with the publication Hustlers (steidldangin). Created by Pascal Dangin in collaboration with the artist, this large-scale publication presents the series in its entirety.</p>

<p>Hustlers marks the beginning of diCorcia’s engagement with street photography. Many of his works appear to depict random events in public settings, yet rarely involve chance. For this project, each composition was carefully arranged before nearby hustlers were approached, and the result is a series of loaded narratives that revolve around a tension between the subject’s unique presence in front of the camera and the artist’s predetermined idea for the shoot. Depicted in a variety of settings including vacant lots, fast food chains, bus stops, and motel rooms, the hustlers are identified in the titles of the photographs by their name, age, place of birth, and payment received for posing for the camera.</p>

<p>ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE - FASHION SHOW</p>

<p>At the core of Fashion Show are photographs Mapplethorpe shot for publications such as Italian Vogue, French Vogue and L.A. Style in the mid- to late-1980s, most of which haven't been exhibited before. Beyond his instantly recognisable mastery of relaying beauty and perfection, in these commissioned works Mapplethorpe employs strong geometric elements and constructed contexts to generate elegant but unusually charged narratives. As such, these scenes feel strikingly contemporary - precursors to developments in fashion photography over the ensuing three decades.</p>

<p>"In the next decade with new cameras, Robert did wonderful portraits of our friend and muse Dovanna. The elegance of mind and body resulted in some of Robert's best images that turned fashion into art. I believe he was one of the first modern artists to cross the line drawn firmly in that territory."
David Croland</p>

<p>Many of the photographs reveal Mapplethorpe's love of high-fashion fabrics and garments. In some, he photographed his better-known muses with their backs to the camera so that the viewer's attention is focused entirely on the materials, cuts and forms of their dresses, zebra striped fabric, luxurious fur or crushed silk. In others he created intensity through fusing apparently discordant elements like a male muscle-bound thigh in fishnet stockings or his black model Ken Moody about to devour a stiletto shoe.  Mapplethorpe's love and understanding of high-fashion materials is epitomised with the legendary self-portrait he shot in 1980, showing him in profile in drag wearing fur. This is alongside unknown works focusing on conventional female beauty or the more underground world of sexual experimentation.</p>

<p>IKE UDE - STYLE AND SYMPATHIES</p>

<p>Style and Sympathies includes a selection of self-portraits from Udé’s critically acclaimed Sartorial Anarchy series and, for the first time, the series will be broadly continued and presented. Udé’s distinctive portraits, which poeticize colors, sumptuous fabrics, and composition, transcend the traditional aesthetic of portraiture by adopting a post-modern twist. The portraits show a highly stylized world of color and improvisational virtuosity, in which the artist employs men’s fashion ensembles that have been culled from various historical times and geographies.</p>

<p>At once a reference to and departure from Dandyism, Udé's Sartorial Anarchy series is essentially post-dandyism in its conceptual use of fashion/costume as an index of culture. Udé has been engaged with this body of work since 2010, when the first photographs of this series were presented in the exhibition, The Global Africa Project, at the Museum of Arts and Design (MAD), New York. Most recently, Udé has continued his Sartorial Anarchy series for the exhibition Artist/Rebel/Dandy: Men of Fashion at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) Museum.</p>

<p>ONLY IN ENGLAND - TONY RAY-JONES &amp; MARTIN PARR</p>

<p>Fascinated by the eccentricities of English social customs, Tony Ray-Jones spent the latter half of the 1960s travelling across England, photographing what he saw as a disappearing way of life. Humorous yet melancholy, these works had a profound influence on photographer Martin Parr, who has now made a new selection including over 50 previously unseen works from the National Media Museum's Ray-Jones archive.</p>

<p>Shown alongside The Non-Conformists, Parr's rarely seen work from the 1970s, this selection forms a major new exhibition which demonstrates the close relationships between the work of these two important photographers.</p>

<p>IRVING PENN - ON ASSIGNMENT</p>

<p>Widely recognized as one of the most prolific and respected photographers of the 20th century, Irving Penn began his photographic career in 1943 at the suggestion and encouragement of Vogue’s then Art Director, Alexander 
Liberman. The first color photograph Penn made on assignment for Vogue appeared on the cover of the October 
1st issue that same year, he first still life cover in the magazine’s history – and Liberman immediately “sensed that we were in the presence of a major new vision, with infinite possibilities for growth and discovery.”</p>

<p>Penn developed that artistic vision over the next sixty years, shooting more than 
150 covers for Vogue between 1943 and 2004 (a selection of which will be on 
view), creating celebrated portraits of leading cultural figures such as Pablo 
Picasso, Truman Capote, and Miles Davis, and producing groundbreaking fashion 
editorials noted for their natural lighting and formal simplicity. With an elegance 
and economy of composition, Penn’s 1950 pictures of the Paris couture collections 
revised the visual aesthetics of fashion photography, and the act of placing his 
subjects, whether a model in Balenciaga, a Dahomey native, or tradesperson 
dressed in work clothes, against a seamless, neutral backdrop without context or 
narrative became a signature trademark of Penn’s style. This approach produced
photographs that focused on the subject, rather than the environment in which they might have been found. The deft craft of his still lifes transformed common objects into abstracted elements of modern artistic expression.</p>

<p>BRYAN SCHUTMATT - GRAYS THE MOUNTAIN SENDS</p>

<p>In Grays the Mountain Sends, Schutmaat skillfully documents the rugged landscapes and people of the great American West. The images describe a series of mining sites and small, hardscrabble mountain towns. Also portrayed are the people who have worked in them, built them, and a few younger people who might  or might not, be looking for a way out of them. It’s this balance between the clearly ravaged land and equally devastated faces, with a few moments of youth, beauty, and the last glimmer of promises never truly fulfilled, that elevates Schutmaat’s work. His photographs, carefully controlled in both palette and structure, have a true regional twang. They evoke the wear and tear perpetrated on the land, as well as on the psyche of people who live there, with scant separation in one’s sense of the individuals and one’s sense of the place.</p>

<p>PIETER HUGO - KIN</p>

<p>Created over the past eight years, Pieter Hugo’s series Kin confronts complex issues of colonization, racial diversity and economic disparity in Hugo’s homeland of South Africa. These subjects are common to the artist’s past projects in Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia and Botswana; however, this time, Hugo’s attention is focused on his conflicted relationship with the people and environs closest to home.</p>

<p>Kin is the artist’s personal exploration of South Africa through landscapes, portraits and still life photography. Hugo depicts locations and subjects of personal significance, such as cramped townships, contested farmlands, abandoned mining areas and sites of political influence, as well as psychologically charged still lives in people’s homes and portraits of drifters and the homeless. Hugo also presents intimate portraits of his pregnant wife, his daughter moments after her birth and the domestic servant who worked for three generations of Hugo’s family. Alternating between private and public spaces, with a particular emphasis on the growing disparity between rich and poor, Kin is the artist’s effort to locate himself and his young family in a country with a fraught history and an uncertain future.</p>

<p>Hugo describes the Kin project as “an engagement with the failure of the South African colonial experiment and my sense of being ‘colonial driftwood’ ... South Africa is such a fractured, schizophrenic, wounded and problematic place. It is a very violent society and the scars of colonialism and Apartheid run deep. Issues of race and cultural custodianship permeate every aspect of society here and the legacy of Apartheid casts a long shadow ... How does one live in this society? How does one take responsibility for history, and to what extent does one have to? How do you raise a family in such a conflicted society? Before getting married and having children, these questions did not trouble me; now, they are more confusing. This work attempts to address these questions and to reflect on the nature of conflicting personal and collective narratives. I have deeply mixed feelings about being here. I am interested in the places where these narratives collide. Kin is an attempt at evaluating the gap between society’s ideals and its realities.”</p>

<p>ORI GERSHT - ALL WILL COME TO PASS</p>

<p>The photographic series titled Offering was created during the artist’s visit to the Andalusia region of Spain in 2012. The photographs capture a matador’s meticulous spiritual and physical preparation, portray the bull’s holding pen, and finally bear witness to the encounter between man and animal.  As in previous works, Gersht considers private and collective histories. The photographs simultaneously inhabit spaces of volatility and harmonious elegance.Spain established their modern bullfighting tradition in the early eighteenth century. A highly ritualized event, an impeccably adorned matador baits a bull with a cape, drawing the animal in and out and around the bullfighting ring.</p>

<p>The event most often culminates in the bull being slain.  Bullfighting images are simultaneously seductive and repellent, vital and deadly. As primal as bullfights are, a sense of beauty is captured in its ritual, tradition, and in the continuation of its practice throughout Spain in the same way. However due to recent legislation, bullfighting is on the verge of disappearing and Gersht’s photographs therefore become a form of epitaph, a testimony to the temporal nature of tradition and cultural identity.In this body of work Gersht continues his dialogue with the history of painting. Without taking a moral stand, the images converse with a long artistic tradition of religious iconography. Through contemporary and historical juxtapositions the photographs present a timeless space, a space that cannot be anchored, a space that hangs forever between past and present, between art history and contemporary practice.Unlike the bullfighting images, the series Cells, 2012 depict the holding pens in which bulls are held before they are released into the ring.The pens are considered formally and the three-dimensional aspects of these spaces are virtually erased, as the surface qualities are graphically emphasized.</p>

<p>GARRY FABIAN MILLER - VOYAGE</p>

<p>“I look west, creature of the horizon, rapt in contemplation at the edge between finite and infinite. Others have invoked magic 
or sought religion to bridge this place but as scientific thought evolves such hopes fall away. Alone, I attempt to make myself at 
home in the world, inhabiting some middle place between the known and the unknowable, struggling to accept that here and 
now is all, never quite able to accept this fate.
In the mid 1970’s I looked out as a teenager across the Bristol Channel. Sections of England: The Sea Horizon was the start of 
this wondering. Then it was enough to stand and stare, to minutely observe the flux of weather and seasonal change. I observed 
the great tidal shifts of the Severn Estuary synchronised by lunar cycles. I witnessed the sun’s arrival and departure each day. As I 
stood still, encircled by this constant pull of energy, somehow the passage of time was absorbed into my thought. In all the years 
since, I have sought out the sea and its horizon and over time it has encroached upon my consciousness, so that even when 
home and inland, I carry it close.
As I walk on home ground, the eastern shoulder of Dartmoor, the sea and its horizon hold the east, so that in mid-winter I can 
watch the sun rise from the sea’s horizon. Looking west from the high ground of Hameldown’s ridge, 1745 feet above sea level, I 
feel the pull of the Atlantic ocean, sense its weather systems come sweeping over the open moor. Over these western hills, I 
watch the sun return to the sea.</p>

<p>The new series Middle Place and Voyage conclude the internal horizons that I have made in the darkroom. These are imagined 
spaces, existing at the margins of vision, places held in the mind, an accumulation of all the seaward searching and projected
thought, its distilled essence. This is an intense world saturated with colour, atmosphere, and emotion. Here everything becomes 
possible, yet everything can end. In Voyage the shutters edge in, the sky space begins to darken and close. We sail out and 
perhaps will blaze and burn, extinguished as beautiful sparks</p>

<p>TIM HETHERINGTON - YOU NEVER SEE THEM LIKE THIS</p>

<p>Drawing from the series of images published in his acclaimed book Infidel (Chris Boot Ltd, London 2010), which offers an intimate insight into the lives of American soldiers in conflict but beyond the action of war, almost 30 of Hetherington’s genre-defying photographs will be reproduced in varying scale, including a number of billboard formats.</p>

<p>The exhibition’s title, You Never See Them Like This, is a quote by Tim Hetherington talking to his creative collaborator Sebastian Junger (a journalist and his co-director on the Oscar-winning documentary film, Restrepo), describing the revelation he had looking at the sleeping soldiers: “They always look so tough… but when they’re asleep they look like little boys. They look the way their mothers probably remember them.”</p>

<p>Set against the unexpectedly beautiful landscape of the Korengal Valley, Afghanistan, Hetherington’s still images follow the arrival, efforts and advancement of a US contingent in establishing an outpost in this North Eastern part of Afghanistan. The work highlights the long-term nature of Hetherington’s photographic projects, his interest in narrative, human connection and the close relationships he developed with his subjects.</p>

<p>As days of intense conflict are broken up by long periods of waiting, the photo-reporter explores how these soldiers cope with this emotionally draining existence. Looking at how they build up resilience, renegotiate their relations and manage their feelings, Hetherington ultimately documents the formation of a strong brotherhood consolidated over a period of one year, underpinned by themes including sexuality, alienation/isolation and the sense of loss and fear.</p>

<p>SIMON ROBERTS - PIERDOM</p>

<p>British photographer Simon Roberts has spent the past three years creating Pierdom, a comprehensive survey of Britain’s piers. Predominantly constructed during the 19th Century in the context of expanding Victorian seaside resorts and railways, these structures were often erected as landing docks for pleasure steamers and other sea craft. Growing to accommodate the needs of day-trippers escaping the smog of the city, engineers began to incorporate bandstands, cafes and music halls into their designs, embracing the growing notion of ‘pleasure seeking’ by the seaside.</p>

<p>Pierdom addresses the historical significance of these architectural structures placed in comparison with their modern interpretation and functionality. Roberts’ photographs of ruinous piers such as Birnbeck Pier (2012) are in 
contrast with those such as Ryde Pier (2012) in which the local community and everyday usage of the landscape 
is represented by a skate boarding park which dominates the composition. It is this socio-cultural element of the landscape that has sustained Roberts’ interest, revealing a deep fascination with the way humans interact with 
their environment, and in eccentric British pastimes.
At the turn of the century the British coastline boasted over 100 piers, some modest and functional, others 
elegant, exotic Victorian structures thrusting out into the sea. Now under half remain, the others destroyed by fierce weather and fires, with many dismantled during the 2nd World War to prevent German landings. Britain’s piers have become cultural landmarks, tracing history, national identity and economic fortunes from Victorian industrialism to the post-war boom, and finally now to the recent economic downturn.</p>

<p>RICHIE CULVER - THE FOUR LETTER WORD</p>

<p>Prominent motifs and characters that examine existential themes such as life and death take center stage in this show, and Culver explains: “It seems the devil is willing to travel – the devil and the deep blue sea is a comment on the space in life that feels infinite, whether it refers to love, life or death. When a fisherman is out on his own, with only the sea for company, it is his life support and could also send him over the edge into the water and into the depths below. The devil is always in disguise, he has no real shape, he’s always around us all the time, sometimes there’s a price to pay.” Culver’s passionate and energetic work is often the result of very immediate and emotional responses to his life experiences. His work is first and foremost very emotional and explores recurring themes that are fundamental to our existence, such as life, death, humor, love, loss, addiction, sex and pain.</p>

<p>Exploring and developing this technique, experimenting with exposure and movement, Culver has created images for this exhibition that are almost animated. The mediums of drawing and photography in this sense have many similarities, be it capturing moments and compositions on camera, or as drawings on paper, all his images possess a sense of immediacy and intimacy that is captivating. The photographs in this series stem from a decidedly kinetic way of working, without a defined beginning or end, almost painting with light until he find the composition and story that he has been searching for.</p>

<p>The title of the exhibition "The Four Letter Word" - as with much of Culver's work that involve text, is open to interpretation. The viewer is invited to make their own interpretation and draw their own conclusions. Culver explains: “There are many four letter words, some foul some beautiful. I’ve tried to look at some of the many different meanings in the pieces in the show. Love has always played a strong role in many of my works, as well as the darker aspects of life found around us.”</p>

<p>YONEDA TOMOKO</p>

<p>One of Japan's leading photographers, Yoneda, working from her base in Europe, has had her work selected for inclusion in the Venice Biennale and other art exhibitions throughout the world.<br>
Yoneda Tomoko not only addresses subjects visible in reality but also projects the memories and history associated with places and things onto her work. As a result, through the act of looking at photographs, the viewer is challenged to question anew the essence of what is we actually are able to see.</p>

<p>To Yoneda, who, in two decades of living overseas, has been keenly aware of her Japanese identity, the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake has had a profound impact. Much of her early work focused on Europe, but she has recently increasingly addressed Taiwan, Korea, and other parts of Asia, particularly places involved in the course of Japan's modernization. This exhibition focuses on Yoneda's most renowned photographs, plus new images created especially for the exhibition, to introduce the world of Yoneda Tomoko as it unfolds, in the present progressive tense.</p>

<p>JÖRN VANHÖFEN - DISTURBIA</p>

<p>For behind the aesthetic appeal of its composition, is the ambiguity of aesthetics and human omnipresence in times of globalization. His landscapes are places where people worked, left carelessly and has forgotten, but also places of transformation as the recordings of forest and bush fires in Portugal, droughts or marble quarrying in Cararra.</p>

<p>Man has created with its legacies landscapes that ravage, pollute and crowd mountains of scrap paper and old car tires, industrial sites and abandoned premises of mega cities. There arise peculiarly poetic photographs that irritate and challenge our experience of reality, because they are beyond the uniqueness. And so we come Vanhöfens photographs, also on "the modern, sentimental feeling for nature," which was mentioned by the philosopher Georg Lukás said that it is only the "projection of the experience and the self-created environment for the people no longer father's house, but a dungeon" .</p>

<p>Nature is not the bringer of solace, but "the historical-philosophical objectification of alienation between humans and their structures." Sure, it's almost trivial to highlight today that images are ambiguous. But with the large number of images and visual stimuli that surround us every day and seeing the exact flatten, it seems necessary, especially the conscious perception and attention demand again. Attention describes the quality of perception. Jörn Vanhöfen forces the viewer of his paintings, not only to consume, but reading the images.</p>

<p>WILLIAM EGGLESTON</p>

<p>Eggleston began to experiment with colour in the 1960s. At that time, colour photography was principally associated with commercial industries such as advertising, and was considered unsuitable for fine art photography. In 1972 he began making prints using a highly complex and expensive process called ‘dye transfer’, which allows various colours within a photographic print to be printed as separations. Each colour is printed in its richest form, maintaining strong red and green tones within a single image. The prints are also extremely durable and will not fade.</p>

<p>Mostly shooting in and around his hometown of Memphis,Tennessee, Eggleston depicts the banal and everyday. This room draws upon two series. Chromes is a selection of images from 1969-74 using Kodachrome or Ektachrome film, while Election Eve was taken during the run-up to the 1976 presidential election, and records a road trip around Plains County and Sumter County, Georgia, where Jimmy Carter’s campaign headquarters were based. The ten images from 1976 depict life in what often appears an abandoned and outmoded corner of the country at a moment of high tension and anxiety on the national stage.</p>

<p>Both series include characteristic elements of Eggleston’s style, such as bold colourful interiors, cars and gasoline stations, and portraits of individuals known to Eggleston as well as strangers encountered in the street. Eggleston pays close attention to the complexity of the formal organisation of the frame, often employing strong diagonal lines and reflections, but he also relishes the strength of strong contrasts in colour with vivid reds, blues and greens.</p>

<p>NAOYA HATAKEYAMA - BLAST</p>

<p>“Blast” is one of Hatakeyama’s best-known series and it has been frequently exhibited in museum exhibitions. The current exhibition, however, will comprise a new selection of prints including images that will be shown publicly for the first time.<br>
Hatakeyama began photographing “Blast” in 1995. The series was shown in the exhibition “Aspects of Contemporary Photography – another reality” held during the same year at the Kawasaki City Museum. Since then, Hatakeyama has continued to work on the series and it has been presented in numerous exhibitions in Japan and abroad. For Hatakeyama, who has created works that carefully and poetically examine nature, the cities that we have built, and the philosophies that give them form, the photographing of “Blast,” which is coordinated with an explosives expert who accurately predicts where the shrapnel from the blasted boulders will fly, has been an invaluable experience that has allowed him to reexamine photography’s appeal and the foundations of its technology.</p>

<p>After the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011, Hatakeyama felt that he could no longer continue to make photographs in the way that he had in the past. His decision to take stock of the “Blast” in the current situation marks an important event requiring long-term analysis.</p>

<p>MALEONN - STUDIO MOBILE</p>

<p>The exhibition presents the results of the Mobile Studio project by Chinese artist Maleonn. Maleonn has been traveling in China for nearly a year in a truck converted into a photography studio. With his team of six people and his photographic material, Maleonn has visited more than 50 cities.One can find in this project all the codes of the artist's fantastical universe, colorfull yet tinged with irony. The childhood, the kingship and romance are at the center of the Mobile Studio's photographs. With few resources, Maleonn managed to create a unique atmosphere. He has invited the people he met in each city to participate by having their portrait shot, creating as many situations as there are different personalities.</p>

<p>This pioneering and original project in China is reminiscent of the explorers-photographers who crossed different countries to document what they were seeing by using photography. Yet for Maleonn, even if the shape of the Mobile Studio is similar, its purpose is somewhat different: the concept of sharing and exchanging with the Chinese population is the key point of this project. Maleonn thereby wishes to create portraits that look like "what they'd love to be or have always wanted to be but never had the chance to".</p>

<p>JACQUELINE FELSTEAD - I AM HERE</p>

<p>These portraits are of the residents of the notorious Gatwick Private Hotel. Here self-conscious residents stand with a blanket covering their face and upper body, standing as photographers themselves used to when they stood under a black cloth to better see through the camera lens. The hotel owner states: 'Most [residents] keep to themselves, stay in their room or go about their business without bothering anyone…Most of the residents you wouldn't know existed.'</p>

<p>Anonymity and invisibility are harbingers of social inequality in a contemporary culture that increasingly relies upon visual representation. To be invisible is to disappear. Yet to be photographed is to have ones image join a network of images, the reading of which is usually beyond the power of the subject to direct.</p>

<p>PETER MARLOW - THE ENGLISH CATHEDRAL</p>

<p>In 2008, on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the completion of St Paul’s Cathedral, Peter Marlow was commissioned by Royal Mail to shoot six cathedrals (Litchfield, Belfast, Gloucester, St David's, Westminster, St Magnus in Orkney). The resulting photographs were issued as a set of 6 commemorative stamps and a miniature sheet. Once the commission was complete however, Marlow was inspired to continue in a similar vein, out of his own interest and in the following four years, he shot the 42 cathedrals of the Church of England – an endeavour that can be placed within the tradition of church photography in England, particularly the work of Frederick Evans and Edwin Smith.</p>

<p>“I began by photographing the aesthetic highlights of each building, but the images seemed to merge with one another. In order to differentiate each place I needed to find a more rigorous and systematic approach, so I adopted the simple strategy of photographing the naves looking along the central axis”, says Marlow. Most cathedrals were therefore shot from the same position: looking East towards the altar as dawn broke through the main window, with all artificial lighting turned off. The viewpoint adds depth to the visual experience of the building, while the discipline of this strict approach allows the power of the place to unfold in the dark. Each cathedral was shot on large format film, bringing into sharp relief the splendour of the architecture, whatever the style.</p>

<p>Peter Marlow writes: “Air rifles or the Mappa Mundi: the memories of peripheral things remain as vivid as the historical highlights of each place. I did plenty of research before each visit, and once I felt I had completed the photography, I would spend time sitting in the nave, absorbing the power of a place where for centuries people had experienced the energy, fear and balm of religion. Everything about these places has already been said, but they have not all been “experienced”.”</p>

<p>JOHN H. WHITE - CHICAGO</p>

<p>John H. White (1945) is a renowned American photojournalist. His photography documents the everyday lives 
and political events in American cities, particularly Chicago. He was a staff photographer on the Chicago Sun-Times for 35 years, 
and won a Pulitzer prize in 1982. The exhibition concentrates on photographs depicting life for families living in Chicago housing 
projects in the 1980s.</p>

<p>The controversial dissolution of the Sun-Times photography department earlier this year stirred up much debate 
regarding the significance of photojournalism. Therefore this exhibition highlights the works by one of

<p>BRUCE DAVIDSON - TIME OF CHANGE</p>

<p>Time of Change is presented in conjunction with the current exhibition entitled 1963, which brings together more than 40 photographs depicting events from Martin Luther King, Jr.‘s “I Have a Dream” speech in Washington D.C. to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.</p>

<p>On May 25, 1961, Bruce Davidson joined a group of Freedom Riders traveling by bus from Montgomery, Alabama, to Jackson, Mississippi. The actions of these youths, in racially mixed groups, challenged segregation in bus seating in the South and led to violence and arrests. In 1962, Davidson received a Guggenheim Fellowship and continued documenting the era, including the five-day march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, with Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>

<p>Davidson’s gelatin silver prints depict both critical historical events as well as poignant and intimate moments. His photographs have been described as “extraordinary for the depth of their feeling and their poetic mood” and the work in Time of Change is no exception. A black woman held by two white police officers stands in front of a movie theater marquee sign that reads, “Damn the Defiant.” Martin Luther King, Jr. is shown with Mrs. King and Rosa Parks in a 1965 print. The day-to-day existence of Southerners is depicted in images where black nannies are caring for white children, three bridesmaids are dressed to the nines, boys are picking cotton, couples are dancing near a jukebox, and hecklers are taunting the Freedom Riders in Montgomery.</p>

<p>SUSANNAH RAY - WHAT ARE THE WILD WAVES SAYING</p>

<p>The show examines the effects last year’s hurricane had on the community of the Rockaways in New York, both on the lives of people who have chosen to call the area home, and on the environment itself.</p>

<p>Last year, hurricane Sandy’s seventeen foot surge pushed across the peninsula of the Rockaways, leaving behind water-logged basements and first floors, their remnants piled in front of home after home, block after block. The boardwalk, which nearly ran the length of the peninsula, was severed from its concrete foundation, slammed into shorefront homes and deposited on cars. It was an unprecedented disaster in the Rockaways and countless other coastal communities, where the scale and scope of the trauma, suffering and uncertainty would unfold slowly in the following weeks and months.</p>

<p>People told tales of survival, digging out, rebuilding, and hoping for things to get back to normal. Each person’s story reflects a long history of settlement along the peninsula, from the close-knit Breezy Point community on the west end all the way to Far Rockaway on the east. The floodwaters united the disparate populations of the peninsula through shared trauma and struggle, yet as they receded and the clean-up dragged on, longstanding differences resurfaced. What are the Wild Waves Saying documents the lingering aftermath of the storm and the individuals that comprise the complex community of the Rockaways. The audio interviews and photographic portraits delve into each subject’s storm story and uncover the deep connections to the land and the sea.</p>

<p>MARK NEVILLE - DEEDS NOT WORDS</p>

<p>Deeds Not Words is an experimental documentary and an urgent intervention. For 18 months Mark Neville photographed the town of Corby in Northamptonshire: its people, its culture and the effects of environmental pollution that led to several babies being born with serious birth defects. Neville followed the ‘Corby 16’ as they fought, successfully, to indict the local council for negligent disposal of waste from the town’s steel mills which had closed in the 1980s. In 2011 Neville produced a book, comprised of his photographs, scientific findings and a summary of the case. This was not for sale but was sent to each of the 433 local authorities in the UK, and to environmental agencies internationally, to raise awareness of issues around the handling of toxic waste and the reuse of contaminated land.</p>

<p>The photographs present the community as a whole, not simply the families at the centre of the case. They show the persisting Scottish identity in the English town, even amongst third and fourth generation families, and on various manifestations of ‘beauty’: young women at nightclubs, entrants in a beauty contest, children dressed for the town’s Highland Games. It’s a story of industrial growth and decline, regeneration and solidarity. Two boys involved in the court case, George Taylor and Ben Vissian, both born with fingers missing, are given a context, surrounded by other members of their community whose lives have been shaped by some of the samesocio-economic factors.</p>

<p>Considered one of the most prominent jazz photographers, Herman Leonard was born the son of Romanian immigrants in Allentown, Pennsylvania and first picked up a camera at the age of nine. Shy by nature, Leonard found photography to be a way of connecting with those around him—from his high school peers to famous figures like Harry Truman and Martha Graham, whom he photographed as an assistant to master Canadian portrait photographer Yousuf Karsh. Later assignments would take him to East Asia, where in the 1950s he served as Marlon Brando's personal photographer, and Paris, where he worked as a correspondent for Playboy and Time magazines.</p>

<p>Leonard's most enduring pursuit was quintessentially American: jazz. He established a studio in the heart of Greenwich Village in 1949, and with his passion for the music and kind respect for those he photographed, he was accorded an unprecedented inside view of the New York jazz scene. Making use of techniques like backlighting, strobe lighting, and smoke, his photos dissolve the space between subject and lens, ensconcing the viewer in ambient gradations of shadow and light. Within his illuminated figures, Leonard exacts moments of delicate detail—an upturned lip and crinkled eye, the glint of a spotlight on a microphone—to grasp energy and emotion. Off-kilter framing accentuates the here-and-now feeling of the photographs: it's as if we've been dropped into the scene, hiding in the hazy dark at the base of the microphone or blasted with the trumpet's effervescent air.</p>

<p>WALKER EVANS - AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHS</p>

<p>Walker Evans created a collective portrait of the Eastern United States during a decade of profound transformation, one that coincided with the flood of everyday images, both still and moving, from an expanding mass culture and the construction of a Modernist history of photography.</p>

<p>Comprising approximately 60 prints from the MoMA collection that were included in the 1938 book or exhibition, the installation maintains the bipartite organization of the originals: the first section portrays American society through images of its individuals and social contexts, while the second consists of photographs of American cultural artifacts, the architecture of Main streets, factory towns, rural churches, and wooden houses. The pictures provide neither a coherent narrative nor a singular meaning, but rather create connections through the repetition and interplay of pictorial structures and subject matter.</p>

<p>JOCELYN BAIN HOGG - MUSE</p>

<p>Muse takes the premise from J.G. Ballard's book "The Kindness of Women" where the author states that beauty is the square inch of skin seen on waking up close to the one you love. These strikingly intimate close-up photographs of Bain Hogg's friends and close relations depict an honest and personal insight into femininity. The work explores beauty and female emotion in an unvarnished and un-retouched manner, challenging the 21st Century ethos of cosmetic enhancement and airbrushed magazine perfection.</p>

<p>MILES ALDRIDGE - SHORT BREATHS</p>

<p>Beauty is always bizarre. I don't mean to say that it is deliberately, coldly bizarre, for in that case it would be a monster that has gone off the rails of life. I say that it always contains a hint of the bizarre, which makes it Beauty in particular - Charles Baudelaire</p>

<p>Presented as large scale prints, SHORT BREATHS brings together a body of work which explores sensuality and malaise in modern life through a language of vivid colour and unexplained narratives. Aldridge’s images of beautiful women placed in a hermetically sealed parallel universe of luxury are both thrilling and unsettling. Executed with the precision of a Hollywood movie, their power derives from the tension created between exterior perfection and internal turmoil.</p>

<p>Aldridge has said about his work, “A slightly uncomfortable quality is what I'm after. I don't feel like making happy pictures about beautiful models being content… these pictures… they’re pictures of humans not mannequins. They’re troubled, wounded and confused, questioning who they are now that they have everything they want.”</p>

<p>Born in London in 1964, Aldridge studied illustration at Central St Martins and briefly directed music videos before becoming a photographer in the mid-90s. He has published his work in many influential magazines including Vogue Italia, Numéro, The New York Times and The New Yorker. His work was showcased in Weird Beauty at the International Center for Photography in New York in 2009 and he has works in the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London.</p>

<p>ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE - FETISH</p>

<p>Mapplethorpe took his first photographs using a Polaroid camera. He did not consider himself a photographer, but wished to use his own photographic images in his paintings, rather than pictures from magazines. "I never liked photography," he is quoted as saying, "Not for the sake of photography. I like the object. I like the photographs when you hold them in your hand." His first Polaroids were self-portraits and the first of a series of portraits of his close friend, the singer-artist-poet Patti Smith. These early photographic works were generally shown in groups or elaborately presented in shaped and painted frames that were as significant to the finished piece as the photograph itself. The shift to photography as Mapplethorpe's sole means of expression happened gradually during the mid-seventies. He acquired a large format press camera and began taking photographs of a wide circle of friends and acquaintances. These included artists, composers, socialites, pornographic film stars and members of the S &amp; M underground. Some of these photographs were shocking for their content but exquisite in their technical mastery. Mapplethorpe told ARTnews in late 1988, "I don't like that particular word 'shocking.' I'm looking for the unexpected. I'm looking for things I've never seen before… I was in a position to take those pictures. I felt an obligation to do them."</p>

<p>During the early 1980s, Mapplethorpe's photographs began a shift toward a phase of refinement of subject and an emphasis on classical formal beauty. During this period he concentrated on statuesque male and female nudes, delicate flower still lifes, and formal portraits of artists and celebrities. He continued to challenge the definition of photography by introducing new techniques and formats to his oeuvre: color polaroids, photogravure, platinum prints on paper and linen, cibachomes and dye transfer color prints, as well as his earlier black-and-white gelatin silver prints.</p>

<p>NIKOLAY BAKHAREV - AMATEURS AND LOVERS</p>

<p>Bakharev's work has historically been divided between private and public. In 2012 we included a selection of the public work in a three-person show along with Miroslav Tichy and Gerard Fieret. In Amateurs and Lovers we will combine images from both private series, made between 1980 and the present. During the Soviet era it was illegal to photograph nudes in Russia, so the public bathers provided a surrogate. Taking on the role of "beach photographer" enabled Bakharev to both earn a living and depict his subjects in a much more revealing way than was officially permitted. He carefully arranges his subjects into compelling poses in which the physical contact is erotically charged, and at the same time display vulnerability and elegance. Later, Bakharev arranged to photograph his subjects at home, often having met them at the beach. While the private images of women or couples photographed nude in their homes are more provocative and overtly sexual, they are also homey, with strange selections of objects inserted into the interiors including books, paintings and liqueur bottles that seem to indicate a hidden but deliberate iconography.</p>

<p>As a critic in the Economist said of the Ostalgia show : "All of this art is political, by the simple act of its creation." Bakharev was an orphan (his parents died when he was four) who worked as a mechanic until he developed his profession as a self-trained photographer. He grew up in East Russia near Mongolia where he still lives. The beautifully printed and modestly scaled black and white photographs of Amateurs and Lovers are serious and playful, mysterious and direct, connected to other photographers (Arbus, Judith Joy Ross, Nicholas Nixon) and very much their own vision. Bakharev is included in the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston and the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>

<p>BEN SEELEY - YELLOW FLY</p>

<p>Ben Seeley’s practice is rooted in an exploration and celebration of photography’s 
limitations. He is interested in the indexical nature of the medium and its inherent bond with reality. Seeley’s photographic series’ are carefully edited, sequenced and titled in 
order to complicate, contradict or undercut first impressions, quietly revealing an idea of the environment or context in which they were made.</p>

<p>The notion of “place” seems more fraught than is commonly supposed; this is not just the static relation of place and habitation, but rather the dynamic interplay of varied forces. With his series Yellow Fly, Ben Seeley is attempting to describe the unconscious dimensions of architectural space as a social process, one perhaps outwardly defined by use, but not made wholly comprehensible by it either. The result is an intriguing group of urban landscapes, which combines a reserved, even austere formality with a distinct undercurrent of psychological estrangement.</p>

<p>SEAMUS HARAHAN &amp; CHRISTOPHER STEWART</p>

<p>Seamus Harahan's films are studies of human behaviour. Harahan sets up his camera and often uses a long, single take, as if from CCTV, focusing on a particular human activity being performed at a distance. The activity remains inexplicable: two young men making semaphore signals across a river, in Blue Eyes; while in Cold Open, a group of teenage children scuffling and idling in the middle of a busy road. Harahan scrutinizes the activity, occasionally zooming back as though to provide further clues, to locate and context the behaviour. As the artist puts it, he 'maps emotional and intellectual spaces.'</p>

<p>In the new work at Gimpel Fils, Torch (extended), we observe a figure lurking among bushes in a road of terraced houses. The long-range viewpoint moves back and forth, keeping the man's balding head in view. He is a university bookbinder tending his premises frontage and continuing to trim the hedge of his student neighbour's garden, although his suit and tie do not lend themselves to this. Harahan mediates this seemingly strange act of urban vanity and altruism, soundtracked by Marc Almond and Cindy Ecstasy singing of the tentative signs of new love, displacing again any simple, single narrative.</p>

<p>Christopher Stewart's photographs, from his Insecurity series, deal with a subject familiar to the artist: personnel from security companies and covert operators. Photographed alone or in small groups, isolated in sombre rural or strange urban settings, it is hard to know whether the protagonists are acting out their tasks, or simply awaiting orders. That the act of preparation in the photographs takes place in the ready made environments of familiar city streets, motels, parking lots and shopping malls, simply adds to the verisimilitude of the mileu he photographs.</p>

<p>JAMES BARNOR - EVER YOUNG</p>

<p>James Barnor’s career covers a remarkable period in history, bridging continents and photographic genres to create a transatlantic narrative marked by his passionate interest in people and cultures. Through the medium of portraiture, Barnor’s photographs represent societies in transition: Ghana moving towards its independence and London becoming a cosmopolitan, multicultural metropolis.</p>

<p>The exhibition showcases a range of street and studio photographs – modern and vintage - with elaborate backdrops, fashion portraits in glorious colour, as well as social documentary features, many commissioned for pioneering South African magazine Drum during the ‘swinging 60s’ in London.</p>

<p>In the early 1950s, Barnor’s photographic studio Ever Young in Jamestown, Accra was visited by civil servants and dignitaries, performance artists and newly-weds. During this period, Barnor captured intimate moments of luminaries and key political figures such as Ghana’s first Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah as he pushed for pan-African unity, and commonwealth boxing champion Roy Ankrah. In 1960s London, Barnor photographed Muhammad Ali training for a fight at Earl’s Court, BBC Africa Service reporter Mike Eghan posing at Piccadilly Circus and a multinational cohort of fashionable Drum cover girls.</p>

<p>VANESSA WINSHIP - SHE DANCES ON JACKSON</p>

<p>In 2011 Vanessa Winship was the recipient of the Henri Cartier Bresson Award which funds an artist to pursue a new photographic project. For over a year Winship travelled across the United States, from California to Virginia, New Mexico to Montana, in pursuit of the fabled ‘American dream’. she dances on Jackson presents a conversation, a lyrical and lilting interaction between landscape and portrait exploring the vastness of the United States and attempting to understand the link between a territory and its inhabitants. For Winship this relationship is inextricable; places accrue particular meanings according to the people she meets, what she sees, and by what's happening to her personally. Each human encounter, sound and smell adds extra dimensions to her work and the resulting photographs.</p>

<p>she dances on Jackson marks a progression. Stylistically similar to her previous work using black and white film and a large format camera, Winship’s portraits remain arresting and unnerving but this body of work reveals her to also be a skilled landscape photographer. For Winship photography is a process of literacy, a path by which she understands life. Her intimate approach enables the reader to glimpse the world as she sees it, if only for a moment.</p>

<p>EVERYDAY EPIPHANIES</p>

<p>Since the birth of photography in 1839, artists have used the medium to explore subjects close to home, the quotidian, intimate, and overlooked aspects of everyday existence. This exhibition examines the photographs and videos made by a wide range of artists during the last four decades. Featuring forty works from the Museum's collection, it includes photographs by John Baldessari, Philip-Lorca diCorcia, Fischli &amp; Weiss, Jan Groover, Robert Gober, Nan Goldin, Elizabeth McAlpine, Gabriel Orozco, David Salle, Robert Smithson, Stephen Shore, and William Wegman among others, as well as video by artists such as Martha Rosler, Ilene Segalove, and Svetlana and Igor Kopystiansky.</p>

<p>As the counterculture swelled in the late 1960s, daily life as it had been lived in Western Europe and America since the cookie-cutter 1950s came into question. Everything from feminism to psychedelic drugs to space exploration suggested a nearly infinite array of alternative ways to perceive reality; and artists and thinkers in the sixties and seventies proposed a "revolution of everyday life" that would cast off the shackles of deadened perception.</p>

<p>In the 1980s, artists' renewed interest in conventions of narrative and genre led to often highly staged or produced images that hint at how even our deepest feelings are mediated by the images that surround us. In the wake of the economic crash of the late 1980s, photographers increasingly focused on what was swept under the carpet—the taboo and the repressed—often in slightly sinister works tinged with dread. At the same moment, Gabriel Orozco traveled the globe using the humblest of cast-off materials, such as an empty shoebox in the snow, to make fragile, economical sculptures that required photography to communicate their existence.</p>

<p>COMMON GROUND</p>

<p>Common Ground: New American Street Photography and will feature the work of 5 contemporary American photographers that are changing the nature of street photography and giving us yet another way to view the world.</p>

<p>Common Ground is curated by Stephen McLaren, co-author of Street Photography Now (Thames and Hudson, 2010); The exhibition will feature photography by highly-accomplished American street photographers Jack Simon, Bryan Formahls, Chuck Patch, Blake Andrews and Richard Bram. Each of these photographers is currently working at a highly-creative level in cities as diverse as San Francisco, New York, Eugene, Los Angeles and New Orleans. The impressive bodies of work they are accumulating shows that street photography, as an energetic and highly- adaptable, photographic genre, remains an integral force in American photographic culture.</p>

<p>Street Photography's "common ground" is the century-old tradition of using one's natural inquisitiveness and camera skills to show us new facets of life and reveal poetry within the world around us. Each of the featured photographers eschew models, props and exotic locations and instead rely on their speed of thought and their ability to arrange fragments of time and space into beguiling images. The images featured in the exhibition demonstrate a wide range of styles and camera formats, but it is each photographer's highly-individual way of seeing the world and recording it which exemplifies how creative street photography can be when pursued by dedicated photographers.</p>

<p>YVONNE VENEGAS - BORRANDO LA LINEA</p>

<p>Venegas continues to investigate the notion of portraiture. This practice was instilled in the artist through the work of her father- a photographer who captures various social events in the Mexican city of Tijuana.  As a youth, Yvonne began her exploration of capturing images through photographs that she took of her twin sister Julieta, now a famous pop singer in Mexico.</p>

<p>It is this particular notion of blurred reality that fascinates Venegas.  In her images, it is often unclear what is a set, and what is reality.  A few images focus on the fans of the band, who seek to emulate the band members by mimicking their school uniform.  The irony of fiction juxtaposed with reality becomes crystallized in many of the shots she takes.  The process of perception in understanding roles- who is an actor, what is real; is blurred even further in some images, as the subjects of some photos mistake Venegas for her famous twin sister and attempt to capture her image while she is taking theirs.  On a larger social scale, the telenovela actors take on huge impact in the culture with their mass popularity.  It is suggested that a few of the actors are paired with local politicians in real life as strategy to boost election votes for that candidate.  Again fiction runs side by side with reality.</p>

<p>TERRY RODGERS - APPROXIMATIONS OF THE SUBLIME</p>

<p>The artist continues to develop an iconography of muscled young men and slender young women, all more-or-less (un)dressed, adopting lascivious poses in a luxurious décor, ostentatious and baroque. Beyond one's first impression, that of a contemplative voyeur snatching a glance of an orgiastic fest, what then suddenly hits you is the absence of rapport amongst the protagonists, the eerie sense of detachment. The characters seem isolated in their own bubbles, gazes never cross. "My paintings describe imaginary worlds born out of 'offers' peddled by the media - luxury, riches, as well as a 'validated' version of beauty and desire - but then always with a dose of reality running through it. Just how difficult is it for the participants to get out of themselves and to 'connect' with one another?" Each composition is realized starting from individual portraits, portraits of persons crossed in the street and asked by the artist to pose for him.<br>These anonymous figures, who had never previously met, are then brought together at the heart of vast compositions. More rarely, they appear alone, but their attitude always suggests the presence of others outside our view.</p>

<p>In this process, photography plays a preponderant role - the models are photographed before being painted - but Rogers' approach is decidedly painterly. His technique is perfectly mastered, but has nothing to do with photorealism. It goes right to the essential to better emphasize the play of artificial light on the skin, or to highlight the éclat of a piece of jewellery or a fabric.<br>It is also particularly interesting to see him mutate into a veritable photographer, because these images are fundamental to understanding the thinking that underlies his work. Contrary to his paintings, the photographs have no special set or setting: the models emerge against a black background, plain, and appear as still more fragile and solitary. Beautiful as they may be (and indeed are), the bodies do not have the perfection that the brush provides them. And what is more, they do not benefit from the eternity that painting brings: they again become mortal.</p>

<p>LIU BOLIN - MASK</p>

<p>In Liu Bolin's new series, Hiding in California, the artist makes use of his famed process to blend into the background of the iconic Hollywood sign in addition to the pioneering TED stage. Hiding in California No. 1 - TED speaks to the innovative, creative, and groundbreaking minds that take to the TED platform to affect change in the world. It is a representation of the speakers - Liu Bolin himself included - who compile their ideas and their efforts under the TED banner in order to spread their message and craft a better tomorrow.</p>

<p>Hiding in California No. 2 - Hollywood is a representation of the countless individuals who dedicate themselves to the entertainment world that Hollywood has come to symbolize. It also serves as a representation of those who are lost and forgotten in the pursuit of the fame that Hollywood epitomizes. Both of these works speak to an America that is in many ways similar to the themes the artist portrayed in the Hiding in New York series.</p>

<p>In an expansion of his Hiding in New York series, Liu Bolin's photograph, Hiding in New York No. 6 - Intrepid, is a multifaceted work speaking to both the prevalence of American strength as well as the consequence of military dominance.</p>

<p>Mask is a new body of sculptures that craft a contemporary twist on traditional Peking Opera masks. Peking Opera masks are traditional forms of art that are used to depict heroes, legends, and gods found in Chinese history and culture. They are symbolic reflections of Chinese society and its values. By recreating these masks using the advertising and labeling of popular food and drink products seen throughout China, Liu Bolin addresses the rapidly changing, highly commercialized values of Chinese society. By adding a necessary layer to these works-welding masks - Liu Bolin speaks to the dangers Chinese face in their contemporary society. With constant risk of food and drink contamination, living in China can feel as dangerous as working with molten hot metal. For this reason, the series Mask - an evolution of a traditional art form - is intensely provocative.</p>

<p>YVONNE VENEGAS - BORRANDO LA LINEA</p>

<p>Venegas continues to investigate the notion of portraiture. This practice was instilled in the artist through the work of her father- a photographer who captures various social events in the Mexican city of Tijuana. As a youth, Yvonne began her exploration of capturing images through photographs that she took of her twin sister Julieta, now a famous pop singer in Mexico.</p>

<p>For her current exhibition, the main gallery features 16 images taken from a body of work titled "Inedito". Yvonne was on set for select sessions of filming the third season of the Mexican telenovela "Rebelde". Most of the images are taken either at Televisa San Angel Sound Stage 3, on location at Royal Forest country club or live at concerts in the US. The telenovela follows a group of students from an elite academic institution, as several students create a band. The fictional band created for the show became a national sensation and performed live concerts to thousands of fans around the world.</p>

<p>It is this particular notion of blurred reality that fascinates Venegas. In her images, it is often unclear what is a set, and what is reality. A few images focus on the fans of the band, who seek to emulate the band members by mimicking their school uniform. The irony of fiction juxtaposed with reality becomes crystallized in many of the shots she takes. The process of perception in understanding roles- who is an actor, what is real; is blurred even further in some images, as the subjects of some photos mistake Venegas for her famous twin sister and attempt to capture her image while she is taking theirs. On a larger social scale, the telenovela actors take on huge impact in the culture with their mass popularity. It is suggested that a few of the actors are paired with local politicians in real life as strategy to boost election votes for that candidate. Again fiction runs side by side with reality.</p>

<p>NORTHERN IRELAND: 30 YEARS OF PHOTOGRAPHY</p>

<p>Northern Ireland: 30 Years of Photography, an ambitious exhibition featuring almost 200 photographs. Since the 1980s Northern Ireland has produced a distinctive body of photographic work by photographers from within and outside Northern Ireland. Many of the photographers to be included in the exhibition have established global reputations, but have not previously been considered in any sustained way as group of photographers interacting with each other’s work. The exhibition focuses on the growth of new, fine-art documentary practices, more often produced for the gallery space and the photo-book rather than for a press or media context.</p>

<p>Taking a historical and thematic approach, Northern Ireland: 30 Years of Photography begins with the media imagery of the Troubles that compelled photographers and artists to intervene in the flow of press photography that dominated a global, visual portrayal of Northern Ireland in the 1970s. From this response, and influenced by wider, international trends in contemporary photography, an engaged and often polemic aesthetic emerged, individual to each photographer but also shared across diverse photographic practices. With the Peace Process in the 1990s a new dynamic entered the scene which required photographers to think about the social and political past and future of Northern Ireland, and which also offered new opportunities for exhibiting and publishing work.</p>

<p>CHLOE SELLS - SENESCENCE</p>

<p>Using the stylized and archetypal format of the still life, the objects within the body of work are symbolic surrogates, coordinates embedded with notations of exploration and movement. Relics of archaic civilizations, organic matter in varying states of decay, elements of the quotidian, the utilitarian, the exotic and the occult constitute the carefully-constructed totems. Without conferring a specific history, the objects summoned together within each image create rather than re-create narratives. Sells’s arrangements become less a document of an actual place, and more an allegory of her relationships to those places.</p>

<p>Each of the works is a unique analogue C-type print, handmade by Sells, using conventional negatives overlaid with colour and patterns in the darkroom, subverting the tradition of the meticulously created tableaux. The darkroom process itself is physical, dynamic and time-consuming, constituting a further mapping of the journey. The artifice created through unusual colour and warped light is used to heighten tension between the familiar and the exotic. Image fragments and oddly cut prints have been sketched and painted upon so that each outcome is unique.</p>

<p>NYC, c. 1985</p>

<p>NYC, c. 1985, is a group exhibition including artworks by Armand Agresti, Amy Arbus, Janette Beckman, Larry Clark, Janet Delaney, Andrew Garn, Nan Goldin, Arlene Gottfried, Keizo Kitajima, Catherine McGann, Jeannette Montgomery Barron, Mark Morrisroe, Christine Osinski, Gunar Roze, Les Simpson, Gail Thacker, and Brian Young.</p>

<p>Through a wide range of photographic images by both established and less-familiar artists, the exhibition represents a major metropolis in transition. Compared to the 1970s, a restrained optimism prevailed to a certain extent in New York City over the next decade with the Wall Street boom and a general decline in unemployment. However, such appalling blights as homelessness, violent crime, and racial tensions - not to mention the explosion of the AIDS epidemic, all served to shred the very social fabric of the city.</p>

<p>The exhibition includes work that depicts both the high and the low in terms of culture, from Jeannette Montgomary Barron’s portraits of many now-canonized visual artists (including Andy Warhol and Cindy Sherman) and social luminaries (such as Bianca Jagger) to Les Simpson’s blithe snapshots of club kids and drag queens.</p>

<p>Many of the images in the show highlight the burgeoning punk and later new wave and Hip Hop music scenes with portraits of Madonna and The Clash by Amy Arbus, and Run DMC by Janette Beckman.</p>

<p>The range of fashions of the era are well documented by Gunar Roze’s portraits of people on the streets and Keizo Kitajima’s gritty shots of downtown nightlife.</p>

<p>GARRY FABIAN MILLER - THE MIDDLE PLACE</p>

<p>In 1976, aged just 19, the artist Garry Fabian Miller embarked on a body of work now known as Sections of England: The Sea Horizon, a series of photographs taken from the roof of Fabian Miller’s home at Clevedon, near Bristol, looking west across the waters of the Severn Estuary. Taken from this fixed point the lens, film and exposure remained constant, so that all that changes from picture to picture is time and the seasonal cycle. Each image is a simple square, divided precisely in half along the horizon.</p>

<p>In 1977 eight of these photographs were exhibited at the Serpentine Gallery in London and two years later they formed a principle element of Miller’s first one-man show at the Arnolfini in Bristol. For nearly 20 years, they then lay unseen until an enquiry from curators at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, who realizing the increasing significance of this body of work, brought Miller’s early career back into focus.</p>

<p>JULIÃO SARMENTO: 75 PHOTOGRAPHS, 35 WOMEN, 42 YEARS</p>

<p>Julião Sarmento: 75 Photographs, 35 Women, 42 Years brings together a large body of work that has never been shown in the UK. First exhibited at Vieira da Silva &amp; Arpad Szenes Fundation in Lisbon, Portugal in 2010, the collection of images has been gathered from Sarmento’s extensive photographic archive by the curator Sérgio Mah. The selection of 75 photographs, taken by Sarmento from the late 1960s to early 2000, was based upon the common link of portraits of individual women.</p>

<p>The portrayal of the female form, normally faceless women or monochrome silhouettes, has been a major theme throughout Sarmento’s practice. However, the practice of portraiture has predominantly been associated with Sarmento’s photographic works. 75 Photographs, 35 Women, 42 Years not only depicts the female face, but the title of each image reveals the woman’s name and connects her to a time and place in Sarmento’s life. Collectively the portraits reflect upon relationships, especially the connection and dialogue between each woman and the artist. The candid shots capture personal and intimate exchanges, along with more impulsive and playful moments. In some of the photographs the preparatory and experimental nature of the shot alludes to Sarmento’s wider conceptual and aesthetic sensibilities.</p>

<p>ESKO MANNIKKO &amp; PEKKA TURUNEN - PEMOHT</p>

<p>The title takes its' name from a photographic essay realised by the two artists in conjunction over a seven year period between 1989 and 1995. This significant series has been reassembled by the artists and can now be seen in its' almost integrality. This will also be the first time both artists will be shown together in a gallery context.</p>

<p>The title PEMOHT refers to the Cyrillic script for the Russian word Remont – a term which can be translated as reparation and stands as the euphemistic and tragic symbol for the collapse of a country and the subsequent failure of its' institutions, devices and social structures. Within the immediate wake of the Soviet Union's dissolution the two photographers travelled to the Kola Peninsula, a remote area on the border of northern Finland. At the beginning of the Soviet period the peninsula was heavily industrialised and militarised, largely due to its’ strategic position and the discovery of the vast nickel and heavy metal deposits in the 1920s. As a result, the ecology of the area suffered major ecological damage, including contamination by military nuclear waste and nickel smelting.</p>

<p>Set against the bleak backdrop of this violated area, Männikkö and Turunen’s colour photographs set out to document the everyday reality of a disenfranchised community living on the margins during times of major transition. A haunting document of post-Soviet living conditions, PEMOHT captures this new reality with poetry, clarity and grit.</p>

<p>NICHOLAS MUELLNER - THE NAUTILOID HEART</p>

<p>His projects investigate the limits of photography as a documentary pursuit and as an interface to literary, political and personal narratives.</p>

<p>The Nautiloid Heart is a shipwrecked novel. Occasionally, its flotsam washes up on foreign shores: images, allegories and scraps of lore. In this exhibition of salvage from a vanished book, photographs and text fragments evoke this tropical-gothic tale, set on the tiny island of Little Corn, sixty miles off the coast of Nicaragua. Over the past 500 years, the island has been a Carib Indian way-station, a pirate hideaway, a hunting ground for Spanish and British sailors, an American coconut plantation, a Nicaraguan penal colony, a drug-runners’ haven and a beach retreat for backpackers.</p>

<p>Photographing on the island between 2009 and 2012, the artist asked: how does one document a landscape so subject to the vicissitudes of other peoples’ imaginations? The Nautiloid Heart is an incomplete fiction, set in a version of a real place. On a land defined by passing fancy, depiction and projection momentarily converge.</p>

<p>ANJA NIEMI - STARLETS</p>

<p>In Starlets, her latest series of photographs, exhibited for the first time, she continues to combine the self-portrait with the idea of the staged narrative. The images are like film stills or movie posters, with herself cast as the lead character. The stories are loosely told, leaving room for interpretation, and although it is mostly fiction, "there will always be a bit of me in them" she says. Unlike her previous series Do Not Disturb, where she purposely tried to distance herself from her everyday life in Norway, this time she photographed herself mostly close to home, in everything from landmark hotels, private homes and historic architectural houses, adding to the series a hint of her Scandinavian heritage.</p>

<p>The images possess an eerie, unreal quality, combining tragedy with humor. She uses a stylised language to create artworks that probe the false promise of perfection, suggesting that there is usually something hiding behind a flawless facade.</p>

<p>Born in Norway in 1976, Anja Niemi studied at London College of Printing and Parsons School of Design in Paris and New York. She has exhibited widely in both Europe and USA with her previous series ‘Do Not Disturb’, ‘Portrait of the Invisible’ and ‘Porcelain’.</p>

<p>WAITS/CORBIJN ‘77-‘11</p>

<p>WAITS/CORBIJN ‘77-‘11, a collector’s edition linen slipcase book limited to 6,600 copies. The coffee table art book not only features over 200 pages of Waits’ portraits taken by Corbijn over four decades, but also includes over 50 pages of the first published collection of musings and photographs taken by Waits himself.</p>

<p>The book is the chronicle of an artistic collaboration that reaches back more than 35 years, to those first black-and-white photographs of Tom Waits taken by a young Anton Corbijn in Holland in 1977. Corbijn would go on to acclaim for his iconic enigmatic portraits of musicians and other artists, from U2 and Miles Davis to Robert De Niro and Clint Eastwood to Damien Hirst and Gerhard Richter, also becoming a designer, a pioneer in music video and more recently, an award-winning director of feature films. By 1977, Tom Waits was already known world-wide for a series of stunning, timeless albums, filled with songs of a noir-tinged Los Angeles that owed as much to writers like John Fante and Jack Kerouac as it did to jazz, blues and tin-pan alley that had soaked into Waits’ pores from childhood. Ahead of Waits lay his partnership with Kathleen Brennan, leading to such touchstone recordings as Rain Dogs and Mule Variations—his film work with the likes of Francis Ford Coppola and Jim Jarmusch, and his stage projects with legendary director Robert Wilson.</p>

<p>RANKIN - ALIVE: IN THE FACE OF DEATH</p>

<p>Featuring more than 70 images, in 'Alive: In The Face of Death', photographer Rankin sets out to explore and challenge our perceptions of death. Through his lens, the stories of those touched by death are revealed.<br>
They include people living with a terminal illness, those who have faced death and survived, and those who work within the death industry. <br>
One portrait is of 48-year-old Mum, Sandra, who was diagnosed with breast cancer eight years ago.  In Rankin’s image of her, Sandra feels she is displaying her ‘inner warrior’ as she battles her condition.</p>

<p>Rankin’s own response to the subject is reflected in a series of self-portraits and in his ‘life masks'. These include images of living stars such as Jarvis Cocker, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Joanna Lumley along with those who have passed away such as Marlon Brando and Peter Cushing.</p>

<p>TERRY EVANS - THE INHABITED PRAIRIE</p>

<p>Inhabited Prairie, an exhibition of vintage black and white aerial photographs taken by Terry Evans between 1990 and 1994, which explore the complexities and contradictions in America’s heartland, specifically the artist’s local landscape in her native Kansas.  This particular region has a deep and varied history of use. For instance, Smoky Hill Weapons Range, the nation’s largest Air National Guard bombing site, is contained within fertile fields and agro-industrial lands, and is only a short distance from the Tallgrass Prairie Natural Preserve, the last uncultivated tallgrass prairie ecosystem in North America.</p>

<p>Having photographed the ecology of the prairie floor from ground level for several years, Evans determined that the story of the land was incomplete without a macroscopic perspective of what she described as the "disturbed, cultivated, militarized" prairie.</p>

<p>In 1990, Evans began taking flights in a 25-mile radius around her home in Salina, Kansas, cataloguing the farms, flooded fields, cemeteries, ancient Indian village sites, highways, train tracks, bridges, military sites, cattle ranches and industrial gravel pits comprising the land below. Flying at 700 to 1000 feet, Evans could read specific pieces of visual information on the ground, without the entire landscape veering into abstraction. This distinction is critical to Evans’ practice, and it allowed for her unflinching look at the relationship between human intervention and the natural prairie. As Evans writes: "The thing I love the most was learning to read the landscape history from the air. I felt I was acquiring a sort of visual literacy of the ground. It was about reading the clues that told me whether or not the ground had ever been plowed, where the cemeteries were, what part was military, and what the history of all those markings meant."</p>

<p>NOBUYOSHI ARAKI</p>

<p>Araki is the king of provocation. In a very particular - and arguably peculiar – way he has made the subject his own. And here we celebrate those images from his most controversial body of work, Kinbaku, the Japanese art of bondage. Kinbaku-bi meaning literally the beauty of tight binding. And yes, though strong and offensive to some, disturbing to others, the pictures are often beautiful.</p>

<p>Araki’s other great obsession, which he started photographing as a schoolboy, is the traditional districts of Tokyo. In his mind the two – the women and the city – seem to be inextricably linked as themes. He has often spoken of his fascination with beginnings, the idea of the womb, and his desire to uncover that which society seeks to conceal. Sex, death and the transitory nature of life are the ideas that persist throughout his work.</p>

<p>SEBASTIAN LISTE - URBAN QUILOMBO</p>

<p>Urban Quilombo documents life inside Barreto, the occupied chocolate factory that became home to an entire community. Sebastian Liste tells their story in a mythical, almost magical, visual narrative. A town within a town, Barreto was a poor society, but one that also gave meaning and a sense of control to its inhabitants. It provided strength and courage for seeking new ways of surviving within the urban environment. Often counter-cultural and rebellious, the system of values and relationships of Barreto developed until the eviction of its occupiers in 2011. Now, they've been moved to the extra-radius, and Barreto has been cleaned to make way for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.</p>

<p>PATRICK AND TRISTRAM FETHERSTONHAUGH</p>

<p>Transplant is a deceptively uncomplicated series of photographic prints of London blossom trees by Patrick and Tristram Fetherstonhaugh, taking a classic subject and approaching it with a uniquely rigorous, process-based method to explore cross-cultural connections.</p>

<p>The process involved the two brothers walking through the city from their studio, taking a single photograph of each blossom-covered tree they came to until the roll of film ran out. The photographs were taken with a Japanese-made Nikon camera using Japanese Fuji film. The unexposed rolls were then sent to Tokyo to be developed and printed, physically making the journey suggested by the cultural connection between blossom trees in London and the symbolism of blossom in Japan - in doing this what looks like a simple picture is, in fact, the physical embodiment of a thought process connecting two countries.</p>

<p>TOSHIYA MURAKOSHI</p>

<p>The current exhibition is comprised of 15 works that Murakoshi shot in his hometown, Sukagawa city in Fukushima prefecture between spring and early summer 2009.</p>

<p>In January 2009, My Grandmother was Admitted to the Hospital. 
The Doctor told U.S. She had three months to Live. 
I went back to my parents' house as many times as I Could, thinking about capturing her image as Frequently as I Could. 
But I Could Hardly do this Because She was more Emaciated Each time I saw her.　
I walked around my house and Took Photographs of it as if I Sought for the shadow of my Grandmother. 
She passed away in April as the Doctor had predicted. 
The funeral , the 49th day after death, the Bon Festival, all HAS passed so Quickly. 
Continued I to go back to my parents' house to Take Photographs Afterwards. 
The year 2009 Came to an End in That way. 
I noticed That I Could feel her presence more strongly from the photographs taken around my house than those taken of her, herself and of which I had only a few shots. Memories will fade out little by little from one's mind, but I realized that the fragments of memory that were etched into Little a landscape where I Spent with her ​​Will REMAIN from Now on. 
The landscape Which Seemed Nothing much to me Before, HAS Become a beautiful memory Now.</p>

<p>BRYAN GRAF - BROKEN LATTICE</p>

<p>By using found objects, low-fi processes, and an experimental approach to materials, Grafʼs photographs and assemblages explore the opposing forces of control and chance through methods of repetition, inversion and accumulation. Most of the works in the exhibition were produced as unique, camera-less photograms, a process by which Graf can exert certain constraints while leaving other elements beyond his control.</p>

<p>The artist explains his way of seeing thusly:
“As I write this correspondence, the blind is down, covering the 
window to the right of my desk. The window is open and the screen projects a moiré-patterned shadow 
onto the fabric of the blind. This image fluctuates in and out of focus as it breathes with the wind. The 
lattice outside the opposite window is bending, warping under the weight of nature. And at this late, 
subterranean time of day the distinction between the orderly framework of the lattice and the entangled 
labyrinth of Wisteria vines is unclear. The two structures are blending into one another, forming a solid 
inky mass outside the bay window of my studio. This impression lasts for a few moments before sinking 
into the night. Focus. The screen is a filter – a grid maintaining repetition, order and control. Folded, 
warped and tangled, it creates visual noise, disturbances and interference. It becomes a dragnet, a 
visualization of chance-based actions within a repetitious structure. The grid is a lattice, a support system 
for nature; being constantly broken and sculpted by the persistent and omnipresent activity of the natural order.”</p>

<p>TYLER SHIELDS - SUSPENSE</p>

<p>Tyler Shields' "Suspense," an exhilarating array of images that began with a shot the photographer took of himself backflipping across train tracks in the middle of the desert, was originally planned as a series of self-portraits. But then Shields' previous muse Emma Roberts and girlfriend Francesca Eastwood learned of the project and immediately wanted to get in on the action.</p>

<p>"When people look at these images, you see a moment when sometimes somebody looks like they're about to die, and sometimes somebody looks like they’re about to live. And that was one of the most exciting things to me: How can you create an image that really makes somebody feel something?" - Tyler Shields</p>

<p>MARTIN PARR &amp; TOM WOOD</p>

<p>Parr and Wood embarked on their careers at a time when the perception of photography was shifting. At the start of the 1960s it had been the eccentric face of the London fashion world; the visual language of advertising, and a middle-class hobby. Parr and Wood were amongst the first photographers to turn their cameras on modern Britain, elevating everyday life into fine art.<BR>
Charlotte Keenan, Tomlinson Curator of works on paper said: “Taken between 1976 and 1987 the emotive photographs in Every Man and Woman is a Star convey the similarities in the work of Tom Wood and Martin Parr, who are old friends, as well as their differences.</p>

<p>“The photographs are an important part of the Walker’s works on paper collection. They represent a significant period for photography, which was finally establishing itself as a fine art, as well as the changes in society for both the local area and on a wider scale.”
Parr’s images span the period 1976 to 1983 and predate his change to colour film. They respond to his desire to document the world around him before it disappeared, illustrating many of his enduring interests including leisure, consumerism and community. These continue to influence his work, which he describes as ‘subjective documentary.’</p>

<p>Included in the exhibition are a selection of Parr’s images of the west ofIreland, which reveal the modern face of American investment, as well as the unusual customs and traditions of a vanishing community. There are also several images of the patrons of Yates’s Wine Lodge,Liverpool, some of his last work in black and white.
Wood photographed the area and people of Merseyside for more than 20 years, earning himself the nickname ‘photie man’. The photographs on display were taken between 1980 and 1986.
Wood’s photographs are the result of chance encounters. From fellow passengers on a bus, claustrophobic scenes in a nightclub, and well-kept suburban gardens, there is a voyeuristic quality about the work.</p>

<p>BERT HARDY - CENTENARY EXHIBITION</p>

<p>Bert Hardy, who would have celebrated his 100th birthday this year, is rightly regarded now as one of the country’s foremost photojournalists. Though he was a gifted war photographer, Hardy's sharp, spontaneous images of people in everyday situations were more characteristic of his work. His work stands out because he himself had come from a very poor background but his photographs never strayed in to sentimentality and he was able to achieve captured moments that resonate to this day.</p>

<p>Most of the exhibited photographs were shot shot using Hardy’s second hand Leica camera which he personally adapted to enable him to shoot in poor lighting conditions. Some of the editions were printed from the original negatives at the time, but there is also more recent signed work, affording a rare buying opportunity for limited edition photography print collectors.</p>

<p>MEGAN CUMP - BLACK MOON</p>

<p>For Cump, the dark is itself a wilderness of sorts, full of the promise of the unknown. It is fitting that the locations she has photographed: underground caves, deep woods, night skies and oceans, conjure up mythic tales of transformation and the underworld. Some of these landscapes are inhabited by wild creatures, including a fox, ghostly white deer, and a shadowy woman who, in one photograph, floats in water black as the night, bringing to mind the ancient Hermetic axiom "as above, so below." This woman is, in fact, the artist, but one could argue that all of Cump's figures, even the animals, are enigmatic self-portraits.</p>

<p>Replete with auspicious meteor showers and subterranean passages, these photographs transport us, suggesting the other side of things. Stars appear to burn through the atmosphere and the evening sky fills with otherworldly light and color. The vivid flames are produced by deliberately introducing light leaks that simultaneously destroy and create anew the imagery on the negatives. In the past, Cump notes, the night imparted fundamental knowledge, serving as navigational field, timekeeper, and source of cosmologies. Distinctions were not drawn between scientific observation, spirituality, and art. Recent research suggests that some Paleolithic cave paintings are also prehistoric star maps–the stray dots and dashes overlaid on depictions of animals mark the earliest constellations.</p>

<p>FRANCIE BISHOP GOOD</p>

<p>Far From Apple Hill reveals far as a relative term. To experience Bishop Good's large-scale, digital photographs is to fall between antipodes, cut through the center of the Earth on the straightest path between diametrical opposites, slip from memory to lived experience. The artist compresses place and time like folding a map, making visible an expired wind in the shape of trees or the passion in muscle memory.</p>

<p>You can't go home again, cautions Thomas Wolf. Bishop Good reaches impossibly toward her distant past in Apple Hill, Pennsylvania from her present South Florida, itself a transient region shaped by pirates, political refugees, and seasonal tourists. The resulting images draw from these varied locations; familiar bodies and strangers; specific cultures and diasporas; reconstruction and autopoiesis. Bishop Good's photographs are monuments to Walter Benjamin's notion of memory not as "an instrument for exploring the past, but rather a medium."</p>

<p>Bishop Good depicts the place and time of the other, who, as in folklore, is also a familiar. Bishop Good sets upon the world with a keen vision, filtering the darkness of time and place, moment and memory, sign and signifier so that the vulnerability of early childhood, the bosom of a landscape, or the trauma of a torn umbrella is yours, and you can recognize it, suddenly, as clear as a photograph. Bishop Good's work resonates exponentially at the roots of collective memory. Far From Apple Hill is inspired and troubled by memory in hyperreality, both painfully removed and staggeringly intimate.</p>

<p>JOSHUA LUTZ - HESITATING BEAUTY</p>

<p>In "Hesitating Beauty," Lutz breaks down the structure of the photograph as truth and challenges the traditional function of the medium in building narrative. The project is an intimate portrait of the artist's mother unlike any other photographic model.</p>

<p>Blending family archives, interviews, and letters with his own photographic images, Lutz spins a seamless and strangely factual (yet unflinchingly fabricated) experience of a life and family consumed by mental illness. Rather than showing us what it looks like, "Hesitating Beauty" plays with our conceptions of reality to show us what it feels like to grapple with a family member's retreat from lucidity.</p>

<p>Joshua Lutz writes: "Holding on so tightly to what I believed was sanity and being consumed by fear of depression and schizophrenia prevented me from being fully present to my mother's reality. The past few years, as she slipped away from the aggressive paranoia and depression of my youth to an almost calming sense of delusion, made it much easier for me to rid the anger that veiled my life and to attempt to find a place of empathy and compassion as I managed her care. In making this work and simultaneously falling deeper into her psychosis, I tried to imagine a time when the past, present and future collided; a place where the weight of memory is heavier than reality."</p>

<p>MIKE BRODIE A PERIOD OF JUVENILE PROSPERITY</p>

<p>For three intense and prolific years, Brodie crisscrossed the states hopping trains, hitchhiking and employing whatever freely available means to fuel his burning lust for movement. The resulting photographs weave a telling photo narrative relatable to Kerouac’s On The Road, capturing the raw spirit of adventure and unbridled freedom Brodie and his friends sought and lived.</p>

<p>A natural, Brodie’s camera functioned as an extension of himself, an obsession. There was no thought-out intention to document or record, the resulting images just happened after Brodie found a Polaroid SX-70 on the backseat of a friend’s car. Soulfully and intimately depicted against a constant backdrop of movement are savages “riding suicide,” maps in filthy hands, tender moments of slumber and ruddy faces framed by wind-whipped hair eagerly leaning into the next adventure.</p>

<p>Brodie’s tightly knit traveling community was bound by movement, ravenous for life’s varied experiences and interactions and fueled by an intense curiosity to see, to feel, to meet something and someone beyond the towns in which they had been raised. Living outside of society’s norms, this highly creative group lived neither on nor off, but parallel to the beaten path, gleaning society’s detritus along the way to support their chosen version of the American Dream.</p>

<p>DAVID BENJAMIN SHERRY - WONDERFUL LAND</p>

<p>With this exhibition, Sherry presents a new series of analog photographs taken over the course of several months while he travelled through the Western and Southwestern states, recording scenes of the American landscape, in exceptional detail. Through a painstaking darkroom process, Sherry transformed these photographs of national parks, monuments, and familiar panoramas into impossibly chromatic and passionate renditions of the country.</p>

<p>Sherry traversed these feral regions equipped with a large format, handmade, wooden camera. Using an f/64 aperture, he was able to capture photographs that were evenly sharp from foreground to background. This exposure setting was an aperture used by Group f/64, a group comprised of seven 20th century photographers, including Ansel Adams and Edward Weston, whose pictures were characterized by carefully framed images captured in sharp focus – often of the American West. The result of Sherry’s technical process, photographing parallel subject matter, delivers prints that are hyper-real in their detail, exposing an infinite depth. His images inhabit an unfamiliar, strange space, as we recognize the physical inability of our own eyes to gauge such extreme levels of visual information. His attention to process relays his personal conviction, but it also insists on reflection, appreciation, and preservation of his muse.</p>

<p>MELANIE MANCHOT - LEAP AFTER THE GREAT ECSTASY</p>

<p>Set on the world's largest natural ski jump, the video charts the intense preparations for an annual world cup, both in terms of the materiality of the site and the individuals involved. The piece tracks in great detail those elements that contribute to the construction of a large-scale event as well as the obsessive focus required to perform at the edge of what is possible, to attain ten seconds of human flight and to briefly defy gravitational pull.</p>

<p>Explored in the work is the tension between nature and a human desire for control. Arguably many of the processes and gestures observed across the work's distinct sequences contribute to the endeavor to shape and sculpt a section of nature for a specific human activity, to make it perfect, even just for a moment.</p>

<p>Manchot has devised an installation that takes over the gallery, its yard and playhouse and transforms these into a continuous choreography. A small group of night time photographs opens the show and sets the stage: each of the images is a portrait of the location, of its dense physicality and what it might stand for in terms of danger and desire. Further staging devices such as a provisional seating structure and an outside wooden room reflect the material nature of these temporary events while providing custom made environments for the work.</p>

<p>WENDY BEVAN - INVENTORY</p>

<p>Wendy Bevan is known for her surreal aesthetic, and a tender, sympathetic portrayal of the feminine form, working exclusively in Polaroid film.
Each Polaroid acts as Bevan’s negative, from which she works free from digital manipulation. As such they are distinct, precious, and totally unique objects, being exhibited for the first time in a pop up show.</p>

<p>“One of the charms of working exclusively with Polaroid film, is that the collection I have in my photography archive is vast, and ever expanding.

<p>CLAIRE AHO - STUDIO WORKS</p>

<p>In the early 1950s, at a highpoint in Finnish design culture, Aho established a Helsinki-based photography studio under her own name. Her prolific output spanned advertising, editorial,
reportage and fashion for a range of commercial applications. She dealt with all aspects of the creative process, from casting models, set-making, styling and lighting to developing and printing her own images.</p>

<p>Aho’s relationship to the studio space is taken as the starting point for this exhibition, and is used as a prism through which to understand the relationship with her subjects, and – in particular – her dialogue with form, colour and pattern. Evidence of the mechanics of the image making process, such as colour charts, studio lights and backdrops are often included within the frame of the exhibited images.</p>

<p>The exhibition will also include a display of original materials where the images have been cropped and combined with graphics for magazine covers, advertising and packaging.</p>

<p>The photographs, spanning her career from 1950 to 1970, illustrate Aho’s trademark vibrancy and humour, through formally inventive compositions and scenarios constantly reimagined.</p>

<p>LOTTIE DAVIES - MEMORIES AND NIGHTMARES</p>

<p>Lottie Davies work is concerned with stories and personal histories, the tales and myths we use to structure our lives: memories, life-stories and beliefs. She takes inspiration from classical and modern painting, cinema and theatre as well as the imaginary worlds of literature.</p>

<p>Her Elaborately staged scenes are the visual manifestation memories and nightmares, one of her own the day my brother was born and others gleaned from other people. The multiplicity of the layering in her photographs through analogy, metaphor and physical placement gives each image the possibility of numerous interpretations. Self-fulfilling prophecies can often have a rippling effect as the series has delighted audiences throughout the world, whom have re-interpreted and projected their own histories within her imagery.</p>

<p>These are not quiet pleasant photographs to glance upon. They are bold, strong - intensely intriguing - parodies worthy of prolonged viewing. Davies images are for the strong willed, confident individual who is not afraid to face their demons. Colour is key to her work; using bold imaginative strokes she wields the lens towards her meticulously constructed tableaux. Furniture, costume and props are found to build each individual set around her models that are varied and striking in equal measure. Intricate planning and careful placement render her work truly mesmerizing. Strong emerald greens, reds and turquoise feature throughout which immediately grab our attention as the subtleties of detail come into view, whether it be the strange impossible reflection in a mirror or the rocking horse in a maternity ward.</p>

<p>JOACHIM BROHM - PLACES &amp; EDGES</p>

<p>The exhibition will feature work from throughout Brohm’s 30 year career, from early series including Ruhr (1980 – 1983) and Ohio (1983-84) through to more recent projects such as Culatra (2008 – 2010). The exhibition will also include Paradis, an early series, which has never been exhibited in a gallery show before.</p>

<p>Joachim Brohm rose to prominence in the early 1980s and was among the first Europeans of his generation to recognise the artistic power of American photographers including William Eggleston, Robert Adams and Stephen Shore. He was also one of the first photographers in Europe to shoot exclusively in colour starting in the late 1970s, connecting the visual possibilities of colour photography with a newly defined “everyday cultural landscape.” At the same time, Brohm’s sequences of photographs show how important the medium and the artist’s archive have become as reflectors of our day-to-day existence, challenging him to keep developing and reviewing them in the light of changes to the reality of our lives.</p>

<p>FALLING FROM GREAT HEIGHTS</p>

<p>Falling from Great Heights, is a group exhibition featuring photographic works by Siri Kaur, John Knuth, and Heather Rasmussen. While each of the three Los Angeles-based artists owns a distinct style, all have a fascination with photography as a vehicle to abstract locations and space. Each artist’s work transcends the materials used to dislocate the viewer by means of manipulation, scale, and movement. All of them engage with the sublime, the beauty and fear of the spectacle of nature and the unknown. This poetic leitmotif draws their work together, however each artist manifests this in different ways.</p>

<p>WOLFGANG LAIB</p>

<p>The exhibition will include color photographs and projected images depicting Vedic fire rituals, and Pulimalai, a mountain in southern India, where the artist is planning the creation of a monumentally-scaled Brahmanda, an egg-shaped form symbolizing the wholeness of the universe in Indian philosophy, culture, and religion. A group of new drawings related to the photographs will also be on view.</p>

<p>The fire rituals, performed by Brahman priests from Tamil Nadu in southern India, took place in February of 2009 in India and in June of 2009, in connection with an exhibition of works by Wolfgang Laib, at the Fondazione Merz in Turin, Italy, an exhibition space primarily dedicated to the preservation of works by the Italian artist Mario Merz (1925–2003), with whom Laib enjoyed a close personal friendship.</p>

<p>In keeping with his desire that the exhibition at the Merz Foundation not be “...limited to one individual, neither to one place, neither to a certain time," Laib arranged for it to be inaugurated in February through the enactment of fire rituals on the mountain Melavalavu, north of Madurai, near his studio in India. It concluded in June when he invited 45 Brahman priests to travel to Turin to conduct a week–long series of rituals called a mahayagna in the foundation's courtyard. Continuing a tradition that dates back thousands of years, ghee (clarified butter), spices, and food were burned in the spirit of sacrifice, to honor and purify the environment with smoke and aromatic fumes.</p>

<p>For the titles of both this exhibition and the one at the Merz Foundation, Laib chose a quotation from one of the Upanishads, the ancient philosophical texts that form the basis of the Hindu Religion.</p>

<p>The photographs by artist Annette Kelm seem to filter significations as a system of values ​​and codes that are established and stabilized by various forms of image production including their distribution by the art market, media and consumers: among them phenomena of sports and daily life as well as botanics, exoticism, Hollywood film and architecture. She produces both individual and series of works with individual motifs and, in her exhibitions, shows a combination of photographs that refuse to submit to a single reading of a theme or concept. Different ways of viewing her works are offered, but never quite fulfilled-instead they rather seem to undo themselves.</p>

<p>DAVID QUENTIN - SILT</p>

<p>Slit is a new collaboration between photographer David Quentin and bestselling travel writer Robert Macfarlane. Silt - one of the most striking chapters of his recent book The Old Ways (2012), sees Macfarlane walk the Broomway, notorious as the “deadliest path in Britain”. Quentin documented this atmospheric journey along an Essex offshore path that has claimed the lives of more than sixty people over the centuries.</p>

<p>David Quentin’s photographs of the walk are now to be published by Penguin Books in a special e-book edition of Silt. The photographic series reflects upon this disorientating mirror-world and show the transition from purposeful walk to an isolated end - at the mercy of a great optical expanse. Quentin’s work with photographic film; generally using vintage camera equipment, documents various kinds of human intervention in landscape.  His photographs have appeared in publications as diverse as The Financial Times and Artrocker Magazine.</p>

<p>LAURENZ BERGES</p>

<p>The current work of Berges shows mostly deserted homes and urban street scenes, which tell the story of a long forgotten time and more recent present. Whether old-fashioned interiors, staircases or weathered walls and asphalt - the traces of transience are omnipresent. The pictures are reminiscent of his earlier works of abandoned Russian barracks and residential areas, which had to give way to the open brown coal pit and were left behind after former use by its residents.</p>

<p>In the works presented here, however, the subject deviates from the mere past to a transition of an ever-changing present. The old furniture and piles of left-behind objects add an almost narrative element to the fragmented interiors. The aura of a human presence is clearly felt and thus expands the recognizable signature of the artist to a more complex visual language and compositional possibilities.</p>

<p>Berges' documentary style gives very personal insights of the places from his environment, which are carefully selected and recorded in a time-consuming production process with a plate camera. The highly detailed representation slows down the readability and therefore allows close observation. Shrouded in indirect daylight, these places somewhere in-between inhabited and deserted terrains convey a sense of calmness and peace. But although the works seem timeless, time is a crucial factor. These images depict traces of everyday life and the recent past in a poetic way.</p>

<p>JIM DOW - AMERICAN STUDIES</p>

<p>For over thirty years, american photographer Jim Dow has been recording the places where people enact their everyday rituals and regional traditions; petrol stations, beauty salons, pool halls, baseball stadiums, drive-thru burger bars, courtrooms, the shifting, vanishing backdrops of our daily lives. “The hundreds of pictures I have made and the thousands of miles I have travelled could be said to comprise a straight line, my interest in photography centres on its capacity for what appears to be exact description. I use photography to try to record the manifestations of human ingenuity and spirit that still remain in the everyday landscape.”</p>

<p>Dow earned a B.F.A. and a M.F.A. in graphic design and photography from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1965 and 1968 respectively. An early influence was Walker Evans’s seminal book American Photographs (1938). 
Dow recalls the appeal of Evans’s razor sharp, infinitely detailed, small images of town architecture and people. What stood out was a palpable feeling of loss, pictures that seemingly read like paragraphs, even chapters in one long, complex, rich narrative. Immediately after graduate school Dow had the opportunity to work with Evans being hired to print his mentor’s photographs for a 1972 Museum of Modern Art retrospective.</p>

<p>MARTIN USBORNE - THE SILENCE OF DOGS IN CARS</p>

<p>Martin Usborne’s photographs focus on the ever-curious relationship between humans and other animals. The Silence of Dogs in Cars was inspired by a childhood memory of waiting in a car whilst his parents were shopping in a supermarket, and the youthful fear that they would not return.</p>

<p>His “photographs are haunted by questions of muteness. Through Usborne’s lens, it appears that the dog left in the car speaks volumes that we cannot (or will not) hear”.</p>

<p>Usborne’s book The Silence of Dogs in Cars was awarded ‘Best in Show’ in the Creative Review Photography Annual 2012. He was also the recipient of the 2009 Taylor Wessing Award at the National Portrait Gallery for his photograph “Tiger, Rag, Johnny and Emma”.</p>

<p>Faces and Phases is an ongoing series of photographic portraits of black lesbians and transgender individuals Muholi has met in South Africa and beyond.<br>
The portraits work as a visual statement as well as an archive, presenting and preserving an often abused and ostracized community through visual records. As Muholi writes: “In the face of all the challenges our community encounters daily, I embarked on a journey of visual activism to ensure that there is black queer visibility. It is important to mark, map and preserve our movements through visual histories for reference and posterity so that future generations will note that we were here.”“In Faces and Phases I present our existence and resistance through positive imagery of black queers (especially lesbians) in South African society and beyond. I show our aesthetics through portraiture. Historically, portraits serve as memorable 
records for lovers, family and friends.”</p>

<p>Tom Wood has taken photographs almost every day for the last 40 years. The resulting, remarkable bodies of work now form the basis of this new retrospective exhibition, his first in the UK.</p>

<p>Most of Wood's work has been taken in Liverpool and on Merseyside, where he has lived for much of the last four decades. He has photographed on the streets, in pubs, clubs and markets, workplaces, parks and outside football grounds.</p>

<p>Wood's photographs are not organised in series, where one project has a start and end date. Instead, he works daily on an unfolding, diary-like recording of his observations and encounters. He will spend many years returning to particular places and studying them in an attempt to refine and distil the essence of them in his photographs. The result is a constantly evolving celebration of the pleasures of photography and its potential to transform its subjects.</p>

<p>A series of stunning black and white images of the band’s intimate and iconic moments from acclaimed photographer Stian Andersen. To the very first photo he took of the band in 1994 to the very last concert on December 4, 2010, Andersen has been closer to the band than any other photographer. Backstage, on stage; in private planes and hotel rooms: all taken with Andersen’s analogue film camera – apparent in the grainy, atmospheric quality of the images – see A-ha as you have never seen them before.</p>

<p>Andersen worked as A-ha´s photographer for ten years shooting the band’s different album covers and promotional photos. To capture the images in this exhibition he travelled with the band across the globe to twenty cities in twelve different countries for a total of 37 concerts: to places like Tokyo, Osaka, Rio, Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires and Santiago De Chile, St Petersburg, Minsk, Moscow, London and New Jersey. He was even there for the recording of their last ever album “Foot Of The Mountain” and the band’s emotional final concert.</p>

<p>ERWIN OLAF - BERLIN</p>

<p>In a significant departure from his previous projects, ‘Berlin’ is set and shot on location at six different historical locations throughout the grand city, rather than in imagined settings, constructed in Olaf’s Amsterdam studio.
Following the recent awarding of the Vermeer Prize to Olaf (the most important cultural recognition conferred by the Dutch government), this latest series further reiterates his status as one of the world’s most talented, prolific andinfluential artists. With ‘Berlin’, Olaf has again broken the boundaries of contemporary photographic practice.</p>

<p>Creating powerful imagery that is at once historical and contemporary, with a tension-filled and ever-shifting narrative, the artist manages to entrance, perplex, confound and delight viewers.
Esteemed photographic critic Francis Hodgson, in his essay exploring ‘Berlin’, comments: ‘You could see Berlin as an opera. There are the grand elements from history, which are like the bits of legend or myth or biblical story that make up the plots of opera. Here are some of them: The Neue Sachlichkeit (the New Objectivity, an art-history label for the harsh realism of painters such as Otto Dix or Christian Schad).</p>

<p>Here’s the building where John Kennedy called
himself a Berliner (“lift your eyes beyond the dangers of today, to the hopes of tomorrow, beyond the freedom merely of this city of Berlin, or your country of Germany, to the advance of freedom everywhere.”). Here is a broad hinted
reminder of the great Jesse Owens, carrying off the plaudits at Hitler’s own Olympiad, and making a mockery of the Chancellor’s racism in doing so. Here’s the peculiar sub-culture of the duelling clubs, there’s a kid who looks uncomfortably like an enthusiastic recruit to the Hitler Youth, with his slicked hair and his black leather gloves. These are concrete references but not deployed to be specific. Olaf uses them to take us through a range of moods, exactly as opera does. We don’t need an exact narrative because so many of the historical references are so clear.
Instead we get a set of pictures just imbued with Berlin.’</p>

<p>JAN DIBBETS</p>

<p>Jan Dibbets has been a major figure in the international art world for more than forty years. Initially trained as a painter at the fine arts academy in Tilburg, Jan Dibbets turned to photography at the end of the 1960s, and such early series as "Perspective Corrections" became one of the essential foundations of Conceptual Art. To this day his work revolves around questions that pertain to the structure of photography and the mechanisms of perception, "what we see" as opposed to "what we know."</p>

<p>For this first exhibition at the gallery, Jan Dibbets will show for the first time a new series of large-scale photographs, New Colorstudies 1976/2012. Using negatives shot in the 1970s that were quite direct explorations of depicting color without an obvious structure, these new works use a large scale unavailable at that time to create almost painterly monochrome works.  All are close-cropped details of car hoods – "flat and shiny like a photograph" – on which might be reflected sky and trees, photographs that are simultaneously as abstract as they are precise representation. The found industrial color of the cars, reproduced with the equally industrial chemical color of film chemistry, in the 70s Dibbets left unaltered; but in this new series he has often manipulated the color, bringing us back to the questions of representation and reality that are at the core of Dibbets’s work.</p>

<p>THRESHOLDS</p>

<p>This exhibition explores the relationship between truth, fiction and fantasy within documentary photography. The artists included in Thresholds have, in different ways, made work that explicitly address these aspects of documentary photography practice.</p>

<p>Sophie Ristelhueber’s photographs, Eleven Blow Ups, are at first glance instantly recognisable as scenes from a contemporary conflict; familiar to us from the proliferation of images presented in the media. These photographs are in fact elaborate fictions, digitally manipulated by the artist.</p>

<p>Peter Watkins and Tereza Zelenkova also refer to the fictional potential of the documentary photograph. For An Index of Time the artists collaborated on a project about the Byci Skala cave in the Czech Republic, a rich source of local mythology and folklore. During the process of documenting the cave, the photographers were struck by the heavy influence that these tales had on their work.</p>

<p>Maja Daniels documents twins Monette and Mady as they go about their daily routine in Paris. The women live a performative existence in which they pose as the mirror image to each other, rarely appearing in public separately and never without identical clothes, hair and accessories.</p>

<p>Stephen Gill’s series Hackney Wick, also shows the ability of photography to transform the everyday into a theatre of the surreal. His photographs represent the area of London in which Gill lives.</p>

<p>Luke Stephenson is interested in documenting subcultures within British culture. In his series An Incomplete Dictionary of Showbirds, Stephenson has photographed birds commonly kept as domestic pets in the U.K. that are entered into ‘showbird’ competitions.</p>

<p>JOEL TETTAMANTI - COMPASS POINTS</p>

<p>Joël Tettamanti's photographs are a vast archive of the structures, villages and cities that people create and inhabit, and the landforms and climates that shape their culture. Although his photographs are often unpeopled, the focus of his work is the human presence in the landscape and the people who are uplifted and sometimes defeated by the land they inhabit. This contradiction of human frailty and resilience, and the continuities people form with the land, are embedded in Tettamanti's photographic vision.</p>

<p>Joël Tettamanti was born in 1977 in Efok/Cameroon and is a graduate of ECAL, Lausanne. Based in Zurich and Lausanne, he has worked from Asia to the Arctic Circle on assignment for magazines and commercial clients such as Wallpaper, Victorinox, Clariant, and Gigon Guyer.</p>

<p>MICHAEL EASTMAN - HAVANA</p>

<p>This magical body of work exposes the colourful and crumbling interiors and  exteriors of Cuba’s capital. Eastman is recognized for his large-scale photographs of the world’s most beautiful cities including Rome, Paris, and New Orleans. Inspired by Aaron Siskind, Eastman is transfixed by the textures of architectural decay and the narrative they reveal about the life of a building. This often leads Eastman to abstraction: areas of walls are cropped, reducing them to flat painterly planes of colour. In other instances, he draws us in with expansive perspectives creating inviting depths into rooms and doorways. His exacting technique of long exposure times, no artificial light and a wide angled lens captures a realistic field of vision, authentic light and colour.</p>

<p>“Putting one of his photographs up is like punching a hole in the wall and opening onto a vista of a much grander room than the one you are in”- Vicki Goldberg
It is the details of these pictures which make them endlessly fascinating and poignant: ghostly rectangles of lighter colour on walls where paintings once hung, beach chairs that stand in for finely carved furniture, laden clothes lines hanging amongst chandeliers, above intricately tiled floors.</p>

<p>But these exquisitely deteriorating rooms and facades also tell a larger story: these are the homes of the successful and rich, who were knocked off their pedestals by revolution and whose country, abandoned by its Russian supporters and blockaded by America,  still has very little in the way of material goods.  While his photographs may provoke nostalgia for the glory days of Havana, Eastman’s emphasis is on the subtle grandeur of these buildings in ruin, the beauty inherent in decay.</p>

<p>LARRY CLARK - TULSA</p>

<p>For the first time in Sweden, the exhibition will present Clark’s magnum opus, the notoriously iconic Tulsa-monograph, compromising the complete series of fifty vintage photographs from a private collection.<br>
Taken in Tulsa, Oklahoma between 1963 and 1971, when the artist was in his twenties, the images are acclaimed for their powerful impact as both social documentary and subjective autobiography.</p>

<p>The main theme for Larry Clark’s body of work has always been honesty. With an unapologetic, unorthodox, and unedited depiction of sex, drugs and other vices, the Tulsa-series is acclaimed by critics for stripping bare the myth that Middle America had been immune to the social convulsions that rocked America in the 1960’s.</p>

<p>From rouge artist to rebel icon, Larry Clark has served as a saint of provocation and his documentary aesthetic has inspired generations of artists and filmmakers. Without Larry Clark there would be no Nan Goldin, Ryan McGinley, Terry Richardson, Wolfgang Tillmans, Juergen Teller, Spike Jonze, Martin Scorsese, or Gus Van Sant.</p>

<p>TARYN SIMON - THE PICTURE COLLECTION</p>

<p>The Picture Collection comprises forty-four works inspired by the New York Public Library’s picture archive, one of the august institution’s lesser-known troves. The archive contains 1.2 million prints, postcards, posters, and printed images, most of which have been cut from secondary sources, such as books and magazines. It is the largest circulating picture library in the world, organized according to a complex cataloging system of over 12,000 subject headings.</p>

<p>Since its inception in 1915, it has been an important resource for writers, historians, artists, filmmakers, fashion designers, and advertising agencies. Diego Rivera, who made use of it for his legendary mural for the Rockefeller Center, Man at the Crossroads (1934), noted how the scope of this picture collection might go on to shape contemporary visions of America.</p>

<p>Each work is made up of a number of images that Simon has selected from a given archival category, such as Chiaroscuro, Handshaking, Haircombing, Express Highways, Financial Panics, Israel, and Beards and Mustaches.  In artfully overlapped compositions, only slices of the individual images are visible, each fragment intimating its whole. Thus multiple related images are transformed into almost abstract color fields and geometric shapes. The framing and mounting has been specifically designed to make reference to early hanging systems in libraries and museums.</p>

<p>TOM HUNTER - PUBLIC SPACES, PUBLIC STAGES</p>

<p>Tom Hunter’s “Public Spaces, Public Stages” is series of photographs the artist took within the local London borough of Hackney.<br>
Speaking about his new exhibition, Tom said, “These photographs are Earthly, here the word evokes the inter-relatedness of the environment to the life that takes place within it... Physical human situations, stories, people and places in-between. I have sought to express and explore a self-reflection and quietness through which one might transcend the immediate realities, pressures and distractions of contemporary urban society.”</p>

<p>The photographs are created using the pinhole technique. According to Tom “My choice to make these photographs with a pinhole camera is critical. It has implications on various levels not only for the construction of the image but also the construction of meaning or interpretation around the image. The pinhole camera is an arcane technology, the most rudimentary of interventions with allusions to the pre and early history of photography. The pinhole camera has no shutter. It makes no sound. Its mechanism; the action of light ‘seeping in’ has the quality of absorbing not grabbing.”</p>

<p>TREVOR PAGLEN</p>

<p>Commissioned by Creative Time, Paglen worked with scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to produce a disc micro-etched with 100 photographs, designed to last in space for billions of years. The project culminated in November of 2012 when the disc was attached to a communications satellite and launched from Kazakhstan into Earth’s orbit.The exhibition includes a selection of key images from The Last Pictures.</p>

<p>Among the large color prints and black-and-white diptychs is Angelus Novus (2012), a photograph of the backside of Paul Klee’s 1920 painting of the same name. Once owned by Walter Benjamin, the painting is an important reference in the philosopher’s last work “Theses on the Philosophy of History” (1940). In the essay Benjamin argues for a circular conception of history, one recognizing that despite the notion of progress, societies produce and reproduce similar economic, humanitarian, and political crises. For Benjamin, the “angel of history” faces the past and is propelled backwards into the future by the ongoing explosions of the present. By presenting the back of the painting, Paglen asks his audience to look back at the ongoing crisis of the present.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is a grid of 182 images collected for the project but ultimately excluded and a video of the satellite in orbit. Also exhibited are photographs, "skyscapes," of nearly undetectable surveillance drones in a seemingly empty field, a massive National Security Agency data center under construction in suburban Utah, and secret satellites in the night’s sky. Paglen’s images are both documents of clandestine military operations and a contribution to the history of photographic abstraction, following in the tradition of Alfred Stieglitz’s landmark “Equivalents” series of imposing clouds in an inordinately black sky.</p>

<p>JAMES SMITH - TEMPORAL DISLOCATION</p>

<p>Smith uses photography to capture evidence of man’s contemporary and historical relationship with landscape, and the nuances of activity that are made manifest by edifices and constructions within it. From Brutalist architecture to towering stacks of hay, these dislocated forms of quasi ‘sculptures’ are evidential signs of power, class and labour.</p>

<p>Temporal Dislocation explores the fine line between stability and impermanence, and the inexorably cyclical nature of the physical environment after human intervention. A primary intent of the work is to expose how form follows function in order to reveal the inherent aesthetics and resonances contained within that of ‘the found’.</p>

<p>Underpinning the work is a desire to bridge the divide between the photographer’s explicit framing of the constructed landscape and the casual viewer’s benign, unknowing or unconscious dismissal of its functions and attributes.</p>

<p>LUCAS FOGLIA - A NATURAL ORDER</p>

<p>Lucas Foglia looks at the lives of communities of people across the United States who have chosen to live ‘off the grid’:</p>

<p>"I grew up with my extended family on a small farm in the suburbs of New York City. While malls and supermarkets developed around us, we heated our house with wood, farmed and canned our food, and bartered the plants we grew for everything from shoes to dental work. But while my family followed many of the principles of the back-to-the-land movement, by the time I was eighteen we owned three tractors, four cars, and five computers. This mixture of the modern world in our otherwise rustic life made me curious to see what a completely self-sufficient way of living might look like.</p>

<p>From 2006 through 2010, I traveled throughout the southeastern United States befriending, photographing, and interviewing a network of people who left cities and suburbs to live off the grid. Motivated by environmental concerns, religious beliefs, or predictions of economic collapse, they build their homes from local materials, obtain their water from nearby springs, and hunt, gather, or grow their own food.
All the people in my photographs are working to maintain a self-sufficient lifestyle, but no one I found lives in complete isolation from the mainstream. Many have websites that they update using laptop computers, and cell phones that they charge on car batteries or solar panels. They do not wholly reject the modern world. Instead, they step away from it and choose the parts that they want to bring with them."</p>

<p>NICHOLAS HUGHES</p>

<p>Dust particles rising through the projector beam of a darkened London theatre form the genesis of Nicholas Hughes’s series Aspects Of Cosmological Indifference, which examines the space between the world that people inhabit and that which nature still claims as its own. In this intermediary space between the two, the photographer seeks to explore the essence of the human spirit and itsrelationship with nature. By focusing on boundaries, planes and surfaces he acknowledges the limits humanity has imposed on the natural world and contemplates the future for both.</p>

<p>With a deep environmental concern running through all his work, Hughes acknowledges the limits humanity have imposed on the natural world and contemplates the future for both.

<p>REALISM IN RAWIYA</p>

<p>Realism in Rawiya presents the work of the first all-female photographic collective to emerge from the Middle East, Rawiya. Operating within what is still a predominantly male-dominated industry, and one fraught with politics, the group credits pooling resources and talents for their rapidly developing profile throughout the Middle Eastern region and beyond.</p>

<p>Each artist established their individual careers as photojournalists, working for news agencies and publications across the Arab world. By living and reporting in the region, the photographers gained an insider’s view of the extremities of these settings, whilst also observing how their reportage could become reframed in the international media’s final edit of events. This shared experience inspired the members to create their own platform, to present what they felt to be the wider political and social stories currently going unseen.</p>

<p>YAAKOV ISRAEL</p>

<p>The exhibition’s title, The Quest for the Man on the White Donkey,  was inspired by a chance encounter with a Palestinian man who rode past whilst Yaakov was photographing near the Dead Sea. The photographer says, ‘It was only after developing the photographic plate that I realised I had encountered my ‘Messiah’: in Orthodox Jewish tradition, the Messiah (the Prophet) will arrive riding on a white donkey’.</p>

<p>Yaakov’s large scale meticulously detailed images encourage us to appreciate the multi-faceted political and social state of this contested region, offering us a highly personal insight into spaces often overlooked by the world’s media. His images evoke an incomplete utopia: an abandoned, overgrown swimming pool in the Northern Judean Desert indicates long standing neglect, whilst a disconcerting armed presence at the Dead Sea Hilton reveals the tension now commonplace in this landscape of uncertainty. Yaakov’s images are filled with allusions to barriers, both physical and metaphoric, which serve as a constant reminder of the unsettled and indeterminate nature of the country itself.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Yaakov reveals the peace and tranquility that also exists, with images of everyday occurances such as gathering herbs in Haifa, or a moment of solitude bathing in the Sea of Galilee. These sights appear so idyllic one would be forgiven for not realising that beyond the frame, a deep-seated conflict rages on.</p>

<p>JAIMIE WARREN - THE WHOAS OF FEMALE TRAGEDY II</p>

<p>In photographs that explore different female stereotypes from both art history and celebrity culture, distorted through the internet’s bizarre juxtapositions, disposable imagery and memes, this new body of work features the artist and her friends in roles as diverse as Zsa Zsa Gabor, Easy E, The Virgin Mary, Lana Del Rey or Picasso’s Demoiselles D’Avignon.</p>

<p>Like a digital age, Midwestern Cindy Sherman, Warren camouflages herself in handmade costumes, sets and extensive makeup to impersonate internet-distorted celebrities, including a section of “food-lebrities” which you can perhaps imagine (“Lasagna Del Rey”). Unlike self-portrait artist Nikki Lee who aims to “pass” in various subcultures, Warren with her Rubenesque body, big blonde hair and rosy cheeks never quite fits in anywhere, perhaps best as her idol Roseanne Barr. The juxtaposition of her non-celebrity appearance with the sculpted and contrived publicity shots of Lil Kim or Madonna bring the unreachably idealized form back to its much funner corporeal reality.</p>

<p>SELLING DREAM - 100 YEARS OF FASHION PHOTOGRAPHY</p>

<p>In 1984, Irving Penn commented that he saw his role at Vogue as 'selling dreams, not clothes'. Selling Dreams is the first touring exhibition from the V&amp;A's Collection to explore the work of international fashion photographers and to draw together such a broad range of important historic and contemporary fashion images.</p>

<p>The photographs reflect key themes in fashion photography throughout the past hundred years featuring more than twenty major fashion photographers.</p>

<p>KEITH ARNATT - WORKS 1967 - 1996</p>

<p>To highlight Arnatt’s conceptual approach, this survey combines texts, sculptural installation and photographically realised works as well as photographs. Early pieces from the 1960s in the form of artist’s prints are set alongside text pieces and a floor-based sculpture created in accordance with Arnatt’s instruction. The work ‘KEITH ARNATT IS AN ARTIST’ questions the role of the artist as a whole. Arnatt was also interested in expanding the meaning and function of an artwork in terms of its relationship to the discrete acts of bringing a work into being.</p>

<p>Groups of photographs such as ‘Walking the Dog’ and ‘The Forest’ from the 1970’s and 80’s reveal Arnatt’s analytic method of working and emphasise the point at which he adopted the camera as his primary tool for producing art rather than documenting it. Series from this period use an observational style influenced by Arnatt’s awareness of the typological preoccupations of artists and photographers as diverse as Bernd and Hilla Becher and Robert Adams.</p>

<p>CHARLOTTE DUMAS - ANIMA</p>

<p>Anima. The series was commissioned by and recently exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery of Art and is comprised of portraits of the majestic burial horses of Arlington National Cemetery. Dumas photographed these animals in their stalls as they relaxed and moved towards sleep after a day of work. Exposed only with available light, these pictures are both powerful and intimate. She has also created a video work that will be screened in the project gallery portraying the animals as they drift in and out of sleep.</p>

<p>Dumas travels the world making evocative formal portraits of animals, characterizing them by their utility, social function, or by the way they relate to people. "The bond between mankind and animals, and the extensive history that it accompanies, is my great interest," says Dumas as she seeks to express how humans "use and regard animals for our own purposes, literally and symbolically."</p>

<p>FRED HERZOG - IN COLOR</p>

<p>Herzog has received significant critical attention over the past five years, beginning with his first major exhibition at the Vancouver Art Gallery and the publication of his first monograph FRED HERZOG: VANCOUVER PHOTOGRAPHS, in 2007. Especially in Europe his celebration of American cars and culture, offhand points of view and a rich palette have garnered much attention and resulted in major publications and exhibitions, and a comparison to fellow European Robert Frank.</p>

<p>This increased attention inspired Herzog to look more closely at original slides previously overlooked and never before printed. Our exhibition includes twenty works from 1957-2001, taken in Vancouver as well as Portland, Kansas City and Curacao. In addition to a marvelous eye for color, this selection also reveals his strong sense of abstraction.</p>

<p>PIETER HUGO</p>

<p>This new series of photographs (2011 – 2012), on show for the first time, consists of nearly one hundred close-up portraits of the artist and his friends, all of whom have made South Africa their home or who are from there. Through a digital process of converting colour images to black and white while manipulating the colour channels, Hugo emphasizes the pigment (melanin) in his sitters’ skins so they appear heavily marked by blemishes and sun damage. Damages that are common to all human beings. As the result, these images denounce the contradictions of racial distinctions based on skin colour. Discriminations that, from Hugo’s point of view, remain ineradicable even in hell, as Morrissey says in his ominous song: “Our skin | And our blood | And our bones | Don’get in your way | Making you ill | The way they did | When we lived | Oh, There is a place | A place in hell | Reserved | For me and my friends”.</p>

<p>E.O. HOPPE - LONDON</p>

<p>Hoppé was one of the most renowned portrait photographers of his day, as well as a brilliant landscape and travel photographer. His strikingly modernist portraits describe a virtual Who’s Who of important personalities in the arts, literature, and politics in Great Britain and the US between the wars. Among the hundreds of well-known figures he photographed were George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, A.A. Milne, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, G.K. Chesterton, Leon Bakst, Vaslav Nijinsky and the dancers of the Ballets Russes, and Queen Mary, King George, and other members of the Royal Family.</p>

<p>Beginning art photography in 1903 Hoppé was admitted as a member of the Royal Photographic Society where, over the next four years, he regularly exhibited his amateur photographic works. In this same year Hoppé was also associated with The Linked Ring Brotherhood and fellow members Alvin Langdon Coburn, Henry Peach Robinson (1830-1901), and George Davidson (1854-1930), who played an important role in international art photography, maintaining close ties with continental and American groups including the Vienna Camera Club and the Photo Secession, New York.</p>

<p>DOMINGO MILELLA</p>

<p>Over the last ten years, Milella’s subjects have been cities and their borders, cemeteries and villages, caves and homes, tombs and hieroglyphs – in short, signs of man’s presence on earth. His interest lies in the overlap between civilization and nature and how landscape and architecture are invested with individual and collective memory.</p>

<p>In the ancient Turkish city, Myra, Milella has photographed the spectacular tombs that are carved into stone cliffs, as if they are part of the mountain. The carved facades appear almost like a cluster of homes, the design reflecting how the wooden houses of the period would have looked. In another image, Milella has photographed a sanctuary in Phrygia, a lime stone formation filled with ancient holes, shaped by both natural and human interaction. A place of refuge, of spiritual purpose and sacrifice, the sanctuary encapsulates Milella’s enquiry into an identity which is simultaneously archaic and contemporary.</p>

<p>The fallen ruins of the Greco-Roman theatre of Termessos stand at 1600m above sea level and almost appears to be part of and contained by the Taurus mountains that surround them. They have endured over two thousand years of elemental weathering, frozen in time on the day the city was abandoned. The idea of durability and the passage of time on language and culture are also present in the image of the cemetery at Van, a city on the border between Turkey and Iran. Muslim graves stand in a snowy field. Their height and dark, monolithic presence make them appear like the skyline of a modern city. Inscribed with Selgiuchid writings, the graves are an architectural model of time, of memory and of survival.</p>

<p>DAVID HILLIARD - THE TALE IS TRUE</p>

<p>In this new body of work, Hilliard continues to deconstruct issues surrounding familial relation-ships, and the struggle to secure a sense of self and place in a chaotic world.  For over 20 years Hilliard has intermittently made photographs of his father, often including himself, exploring their relationship and the process of aging.  In The Tale is True, Hilliard returns to the father-son narrative, using his multi-panel panoramas (polyptychs) to explore a family’s perseverance as they struggle to avoid an entropic slide toward ruin. Their Cape Cod family home, a legacy of generations of Yankee prosperity and tradition, serves as a symbol of identity, entrapment and history.  Within these photographs, Hilliard unfolds the story of a father and son trying to maintain their physical and emotional footing while being swept up in the confluence of a complicated past and uncertain future. The tension between disillusionment and hope pervades this narrative, and is further punctuated by allegorical and symbolist cues within Hilliard’s multi-panel arrangements.</p>

<p>Much like the polyptychs of Renaissance ecclesiastical painting, each of Hilliard’s photographs offers the viewer the opportunity to explore from panel to panel the universal story of man’s frailty, and travails of the human spirit. Just as earlier paintings displayed stories or religious histories coupled with the mystical and mythological, Hilliard utilizes narrative and metaphor to reveal philosophical and spiritual themes of fate and faith, and the necessity of patience in adversity.</p>

<p>HOME -YPA MENTORING 2012</p>

<p>The Young Photographers’ Alliance (www.ypauk.org) charity was created to nurture young photographic talent, helping photographers aged between 18 and 29 to develop both the technical skills and business acumen required to build successful and sustainable careers.
“Home”: YPA Mentoring 2012 showcases the images from this year’s YPA Mentoring Programme. The Mentoring Programme links emerging artists with established photographers and picture editors/ art buyers, teaching the mentees how to work to a brief while honing their technical skills and creative approach.</p>

<p>The small teams of young photographers are collectively assigned a common brief and they are given two months to deliver their final projects. The mentors meet regularly with their teams, offering support and guidance from the initial conceptual stage through to the final editing process.<br>
The theme for the 2012 Mentoring Programme was “Home”. In the UK, YPA hosted teams in Bristol, Glasgow, and London (a Commercial and an Editorial team). The mentors included McCann London Head Art Buyer, Sophie Chapman-Andrews, Independent on Sunday Picture Editor, Sophie Batterbury, and leading reportage photographer, Justin Sutcliffe. The British Mentoring Programme ran in conjunction with the charity’s North American scheme, creating 18 teams across the US, Britain, and Asia.</p>

<p>E. CHAMBRE HARDMAN</p>

<p>Irish-born Edward Chambré Hardman (b.1898 d.1988) is best known for his photograph The Birth of the Ark Royal (1950) and for the highly successful commercial portrait studio that he ran on Liverpool’s Bold Street from 1923, and Rodney Street from 1949. 
The early 1930s marked a turning point for Hardman as he began to develop his passion for picturing the varied British landscape – from the wilderness to the pastoral, in a style that moved him away from the soft focus of Pictorialism.</p>

<p>In 1979 Hardman’s entire photographic output would have been lost were it not for the intervention of Peter Hagerty, the Open Eye Gallery’s then Director. Hagerty played a pivotal role in saving this archive, dedicating many years to cataloguing, conserving, and contextualising Hardman’s work.<br>
This exhibition brings together a selection of E. Chambré Hardman’s landscapes taken over a forty-year period. Curated by Julia García Hernández, it is delivered in partnership with the National Trust.</p>

<p>MARCUS DOYLE - THURSDAYS BY THE SEA</p>

<p>Thursdays By The Sea features Doyle’s images from the desolate area surrounding the Salton Sea, the largest lake in California. Formed accidently in 1905 by a breach in the Colorado River, this lake was, in the 1950s, a bigger tourist attraction than Yosemite National Park. But over the years the local population and tourists have been driven away.</p>

<p>From its main water supply, the New River, the Salton Sea became heavily polluted with agricultural runoff and sewage from Mexico. As the volume of runoff increased, the lake’s water levels fluctuated so greatly that whole towns were flooded with this filthy, saline water. In the late 70s, the entire shoreline surrounding Bombay Beach had to be abandoned, leaving behind a sparsely inhabited ghost town.</p>

<p>Inspired by both Richard Misrach’s photographs of the Salton Sea from the 1980s and the extraordinary light in the area, Doyle embarked on this twelve month project. For months at a time from 2004 to 2005, Doyle visited the Salton Sea every Thursday, photographing the deserted landscape and the remnants left behind. His images capture both an elegance and a sense of re-birth within this odd, decaying environment.</p>

<p>JÖRG SASSE</p>

<p>Whether curtains, stairways, radiators, reflections in windows or unique lighting conditions - with an eye for detail Jörg Sasse reveals fragments of our everyday environment. Since the 1980s the artist has photographed seemingly plain everyday objects in private homes, public buildings and shop windows, unimpressive at first glance. Through unusual perspectives and detail, he transfers the preexisting composition into images with a distinct aesthetic quality. The transformation of a rather "simple" objects into a picture-worthy image as well as its form, shift the contextual meaning of the individual picture and their relation to each other.</p>

<p>For the current exhibition 38 Still Lifes from 1984 to 2012 are arranged and presented in four blocks. Through the use of databases the artist categorizes his works, thus being able to examine similarities and differences in order to subsequently compare various constellations to one another. The interaction of materials, shapes and colors reveal interrelations that any viewer can discover and formulate for themselves.</p>

<p>ERICA BAUM - NAKED EYE</p>

<p>The exhibition will include new and recent examples from the artist’s acclaimed Naked Eye series.<br>
 In this body of work, begun in 2008, the artist photographs the fanned pages of dime-store novels, celebrity biographies, and popular non-fiction books. Her strategic cropping and framing of their illustrations, glimpsed between fragments of text and the turquoise, marigold and vermillion edges of their pulpy pages, evoke new narratives born of each viewer’s own free associations. While Baum’s compositions range from the lushly figurative to more dramatically spliced geometric abstractions, all of the works share a sense of dark romance and a voyeuristic appeal. Featuring a cast of characters that includes political figures, musicians, and stars of 1970s film noir, these flattened images of reimagined stories are created without darkroom or digital alterations.</p>

<p>NADAV KANDER - BODIES - 6 WOMEN, 1 MAN</p>

<p>Coated in white marble dust and set against the void of the photographer’s studio, the subjects of Nadav
Kander’s BODIES. 6 Women, 1 Man serve as monumental studies of the human condition.</p>

<p>Far from the airbrushed perfection that permeates images of nudity in popular culture, Nadav Kander
presents us with honest photographs of the human form. The ‘bodies’ featured reference the forms
of the classical and renaissance past, whilst modernising the genre of the nude to act as a tool for
philosophical investigation. Faces turned from the viewer, but bodies offered completely, the forms invite
the meditation and self-reflection customarily associated with religious iconography and tomb sculpture.
Kander has cited Elizabethan notions of purity as an influence for his bleached treatment of the auburn
haired bodies.</p>

<p>The subjects are placed awkwardly, contorted and twisted or bowed reverently. In Audrey with Toes and Wrist Bent (2011) the form reclines, her toes and fingers curled uncomfortably from limbs.
Flaws laid bare, the figure is exposed and vulnerable to our gaze. It is this sense of vulnerability, and of humanity stripped of its defences that Kander investigates as a point of beauty.</p>

<p>JULIAN YEWDALL - A PERMANENT RECORD</p>

<p>With explanatory text by the photographer, A Permanent Record features over 160 black and white photographs of Joe Strummer, legendary Clash frontman, as well as unpublished images of seminal all-girl punk band The Slits.</p>

<p>Yewdall first met Strummer in 1974 when the then John 'Woody' Mellor moved into the squat at 101 Walterton Road in London's Maida Hill. Yewdall sang and played harmonica in an early line-up in The 101'ers, then briefly managed the band before abandoning the musical for the visual by picking up a camera. These intimate pictures are direct from the heart of the West London squatting movement of the early seventies, that exceptional period when access to abandoned properties provided opportunities for artists to develop their craft without the constraints of financial imperatives. The pictures include posed portraits as well as informal reportage taken when stardom was only a glimmer in the eye of this inimitable artist. The images of Strummer date back to his earliest days when he was a singer with The101'ers, the quintessential squat-rock group in which he learned his musical and political 'chops'. 
In Yewdall's live pictures of the hirsute guitar-player you can see the frenetic 
movement and stage presence that he honed to perfection as frontman of the Clash, 
today considered one of the greatest bands of all time.</p>

<p>MARK COHEN - GRIM STREET</p>

<p>Pennsylvania's rust belt. In Mark Cohen's photographs the overcast days feel as dark as nights. Worn brick walls and pavements feel tired and grey. The streets, back alleys and yards are inhabited by shadows and traces of human presence. Occasionally we find a full on confrontation with the inhabitants of Wilkes-Barre. It is as if the camera was an alien probe in search of the true mood and feeling of this industrial town.</p>

<p>Mark Cohen's Grim Street is a seminal piece of 1960-1970s street photography. Leaving the much walked paths of its predecessors, but not the town of Wilkes-Barre, Cohen approaches photography in a truly confrontational manner, focusing often on the abstract patterns, textures and gloomy atmosphere that results from fast grab shots. Radical crops, disorienting closeups, a touch of of-kilter humour and the strong contrast resulting from the use of flash all took the art world by storm. In one photograph, against a dark and sinister background a woman's face is occluded by a voluminous bubble gum and a hand seems to come off her head, in another a group of women all hide their faces from the encounter with the camera.</p>

<p>WAR/PHOTOGRAPHY: IMAGES OF ARMED CONFLICT</p>

<p>The exhibition examines the relationship between war and photography, exploring the types of photographs created during wartime, as well as by whom and for whom. Rather than being organized chronologically, or as a survey of “greatest hits,” the images are arranged to show the progression of war: from the acts that instigate armed conflict to “the fight,” to victory and defeat, and photos that memorialize a war, its combatants, and its victims. Portraits of servicemen, military and political leaders, and civilians are a consistent presence.</p>

<p>Images have been recorded by more than 280 photographers, from 28 nations, span 6 continents and more than 165 years, from the Mexican-American War in the mid-1800s to present-day conflicts. Iconic photographs as well as previously unknown images are featured, taken by military photographers, commercial photographers (portrait and photojournalist), amateurs, and artists.</p>

<p>AUGUST SANDER</p>

<p>The exhibition of German photographer August Sander (1876-1964) draws together 175 photographs and a wide range of archival material from the collections of Tate, National Galleries of Scotland, Anthony d’Offay and Gerd Sander.</p>

<p>This presentation creates a unique opportunity to see the different facets of August Sander’s photographic practice, including his celebrated portraits alongside less well known aspects of his work.
August Sander’s most significant project was ‘The People of the Twentieth Century’. Sander wanted to create an encyclopaedic survey of different types of people from the first half of the twentieth century. His working life in Germany spanned the First World War, the interwar years, the rise of the Nazi party, the Second World War and its aftermath.</p>

<p>His photographs are unflinching documents of a society going through huge change. The work reflects both the catastrophic political convulsions that Germany was enduring and a society slowly coming to terms with the impact of industrialisation. The clarity and breadth of his vision remains powerful and his vocational portraits still resonate today.</p>

<p>JUERGEN TELLER - WOO</p>

<p>Considered one of the most important photographers of his generation, Juergen Teller is one of a few artists who has been able to operate successfully both in the art world and at the centre of the commercial sphere. This exhibition will provide a seamless journey through his landmark fashion and commercial photography from the 90s, presenting classic images of celebrities such as Lily Cole, Kate Moss and Vivienne Westwood, as well as more recent landscapes and family portraits.</p>

<p>Teller entered the London photography scene through the music industry taking photographs for record covers, it was Teller’s photograph of Sinéad O’Connor for her single Nothing Compares 2 You that marked an important moment in his career. Teller’s photographs first appeared in fashion magazines in the late 80s, and included portraits of Kate Moss when she was just fifteen years old. Teller’s images could be described as the antithesis of conventional fashion photography seen perhaps most markedly in his campaigns for Marc Jacobs.</p>

<p>Picture and Words introduces a series from his controversial weekly column in the magazine of Die Zeit which often provoked outcry amongst readers, and the exhibition will feature many of the letters of complaint that the magazine received. Irene im Wald and Keys to the House are Teller’s most recent bodies of work, revealing the photographer’s more personal world in his hometown in Germany and family home in Suffolk.</p>

<p>As an emerging photographer Tyler Udall has already made a big impact in American photography. In his two short years as a photographer he has shot for several prolific fashion and art magazines and published a book of his haunting imagery, which sold out. Based in London in the early 2000’s, Tyler Udall was ‘senior fashion editor’ at Dazed &amp; Confused, Another, and Another Man and was involved in creating iconic covers of Kate Moss, Kirsten Dunst, Tilda Swinton and Nathalie Portman.

<p>GUY GORMLEY - VIGIL</p>

<p>Guy Gormley's latest exhibition and publication show a series of images taken during a nocturnal walk from the peripheries of South London to the sea over three consecutive nights. Together they build a picture of the artist's state of mind on this solitary excursion. The photographs show tunnel-like rural roads, traces of undergrowth or barely seen horizons illuminated by the camera flash or scarce ambient light. They suggest a tense atmosphere; the photographer alert to unknown surroundings.</p>

<p>In the publication, alongside the images, are descriptions of remembered dreams; notes made by Gormley on waking. They depict ill-defined landscapes pervaded by a sense of danger and unrest. The photographs relate to certain aspects of these records and Gormley intentionally blurs the distinction between his own dream and waking lives by photographing at night.</p>

<p>JOE MALONEY - SOME PICTURES</p>

<p>Although Joe Maloney’s work remains largely unknown to a greater public, he is one of the most important members of the group of artists who belong to the artistic movement called “New Color Photography.” Based on the exhibition title “The New Color,” an exhibition project by Sally Eauclaire at The International Center of Photography, New York in 1981, the term “New Color Photography” has become a recognized part of the art-historical canon. It describes exactly the sort of photography where artists deliberately use color as a form of artistic expression.</p>

<p>In his work, Maloney deals foremost with the perception of reality. The gradation of color plays a decisive role in this process. It is achieved through different exposure times and also partially by making use of a conversion filter. Both means are part of a greater artistic strategy, by which Maloney achieves to set himself apart from the historical and classical themes of advertising and amateur photography. Exposure times that can be several minutes long and the use of artificial light film for outdoor photography make it almost impossible for the viewer to determine the time of day at which Maloney has captured the moment, such as in “O’dells Spring Creek, Montana.” By using a conversion filter, Maloney furthermore achieves a color intensity and artificiality in his photographs, which emanate an air of the surreal. It is exactly at this point where Maloney’s artistic credo revels itself to the viewer. Like no other artist of his generation, Maloney counteracts the notion of reality by way of deliberate modification through color.</p>

<p>FAKING IT - PHOTOGRAPHY BEFORE PHOTOSHOP</p>

<p>The urge to modify camera images is as old as photography itself - only the methods have changed. Nearly every type of manipulation we now associate with digital photography was also part of the medium's pre-digital repertoire: smoothing away wrinkles, slimming waistlines, adding people to a scene (or removing them) - even fabricating events that never took place.</p>

<p>This international loan exhibition traces the history of manipulated photography from the 1840s through the early 1990s, when the computer replaced manual techniques as the dominant means of doctoring photographs. Most of the two hundred pictures on view were altered after the negative was exposed - through photomontage, combination printing, overpainting, retouching, or, as is often the case, a blend of several processes. In every instance, the final image differs significantly from what stood before the camera at any given moment.</p>

<p>Whether modified in the service of art, politics, news, entertainment, or commerce, the pictures featured in the exhibition adopt the seamlessly realistic appearance of conventional photographs. They aim to convince the eye, even if the mind rebels at the scenarios they conjure, such as a woman bathing in a glass of champagne or a man brandishing his own severed head.</p>

<p>ROLLS-ROYCE HOSTS KARL LAGERFELD PHOTOGRAPHY</p>

<p>Besides his work as a fashion designer, Karl Lagerfeld has extensively pursued his passion for photography since 1987. His images have been shown in several international exhibitions, from the Langen Foundation in Neuss, to the Museum del Bramante Cloister in Rome.</p>

<p>His latest work explores a fascination with textures, surfaces, shapes and abstractions that transcend his highly acclaimed position in the fashion world. Photography provides an ideal platform from which to appreciate the finest of details and facilitates the juxtaposition of automobile, light and nature. Lagerfeld’s exhibition explores these themes by connecting and contrasting the forms visible before the camera and shaping a different view.</p>

<p>Talking about the exhibition, Mr Lagerfeld said, “I can no longer view life without juxtaposing its abstraction. I view the world, fashion and automobiles through my camera lens. That allows me to keep a critical distance to my work. This approach serves me more than I had ever thought possible in my view of reality. Each of my shots of the Rolls-Royce is the abstract representation of a concrete reality. The technical medium of photography is a welcome means for my artistic work, creating my different view.”</p>

<p>FERGUS GREER - LOOKS</p>

<p>The extensive series Looks by Fergus Greer was created over a period of six years (1988 -1994) and in around forty photo shootings. Like no other, he succeeded in depicting Leigh Bowery between stylization and performance. The photographer posed the Australian performance artist before a neutral background in various outfits enwrapping his face and body entirely or adorning them sparingly. Thus Greer accented the theatricality and expressive posturing of Leigh Bowery. Even when he disappears fully behind his creations, Bowery’s spirit seems to play with the permeability of the garments enwrapping him and to push through them. In pictures rich in contrast that make use of a highly professional lighting concept, Fergus Greer underlines the sculptural quality of Bowery’s body.</p>

<p>DOMINGO MILELLA</p>

<p>Domingo Milella’s subjects are cities and their borders, cemeteries and villages, caves and homes, tombs 
and hieroglyphs – in short, signs of man’s presence on earth.  His interest lies in the overlap between 
civilisation and nature and how landscape and architecture are invested with individual and collective 
memory.    He is drawn to places where the cultural and the natural meet, where architecture grows out of 
the earth and is born of necessity, mirroring its makers and inhabitants.</p>

<p>Polignano a Mare (2008) shows fortifications and housing built on top of a rocky outcrop, appearing almost as if they have grown organically out of the land.  In Cheops and Chephren, Giza, Egypt (2009), the Pyramids rise up from behind modern apartment blocks on the edge of the desert and in Acitrezza (2008), 
teenagers perch high up on the distinctive lava rocks watching a wintery sunset.  Milella seeks to create an alternative imagery, of looking for a sense of identity and a culture that is simultaneously ancient and modern.  In an increasingly virtual age where communities are being eroded by technological interaction and the pressures of consumerism, his images question where we headed and what kind of world are we creating in the process.</p>

The exhibition, which focuses on the photographer's life-long fascination with water, features images of seascapes, rapids, waterfalls, geysers, clouds, ice, snow, ponds and rivers, many famous, some that have never before been on display in the UK. Adams (1902-1984) was a photographic pioneer who brought the American wilderness into the homes of millions with his images of rugged and romantic landscapes. The show brings together some of the most famous photographs of the twentieth century, such as 'Clearing Winter Storm, Yosemite' and 'Stream, Sea, Clouds, Rodeo Lagoon, Marin County, California', along with lesser-known examples. It also provides the opportunity to see Adams's largest known works, a series of three murals produced for the American Trust bank.</p>

<p>FINDERS KEEPERS - MICHAEL HOPPEN GALLERY 20 YEARS</p>

<p>To celebrate the gallery’s 20 years, Michael Hoppen unveils the treasures of his extraordinary private photography collection in the gallery’s largest public exhibition to date. Presented over three floors, Finders Keepers brings to light 130 photographic gems, handpicked for their fascinating narrative, masterful technique and historical relevance, ranging from anonymous 19th century pictures to iconic post-war snapshots.<br>
Finders Keepers offers a unique journey through hundreds of captivating photographs, full of beautiful and bizarre stories that reflect Hoppen’s personal interests and passions, and his extremely focused appreciation of the image. The formation of Hoppen’s collection, which started in 1992, has grown out of two elements: a strong and passionate interest in photography, and a deep and addictive love for collecting. It has never been simply about ownership. The hunt for and discovery of an image has always been more important and exciting than its acquisition. While the collection features some contemporary photographs, it is mostly comprised of exquisite vintage works, covering a wide variety of genres such as anonymous photography, evidential photography, boxing images, travel and anthropological photography.</p>

Although it is a purely American event, the presidential election is the one political event which influences political and economical fate of the rest of the world to such a profound degree.

<p>Editing from long-term and previously unseen bodies of work, such as the Football Grounds, Shipyard and Docks and Women’s Market, Tom Wood has re-evaluated these images through a creative collaboration with artist Padraig Timoney. Grouping the images in a non-chronological order under the headings Men and Women, the exhibition will showcase a curated selection of these photographs, soon to be published as two separate books by Steidl.<br>The installation of the photographs will reflect the sequencing of the books mixing the different formats, styles and processes. This arrangement will highlight the formal correspondences and relationships between pictures as well as Wood’s prolonged involvement with his subject matter. His photographs include both candid and posed portraits of people alone or in groups. Images of strangers are interspersed with those of friends and family and are often made from repeated engagements with particular locales.</p>

<p>Trust and empathy are both key elements in Wood’s practice and his photographs are the result of considered observation, offering affirmative responses to moments from the lives of those he pictures.</p>

<p>CARTIER-BRESSON - A QUESTION OF COLOUR</p>

<p>It is well-known that Cartier-Bresson was disparaging towards colour photography, which in the 1950s was in its early years of development; his reasoning was based both on the technical and aesthetic limitations of the medium at the time.</p>

<p>Featuring 10 Cartier-Bresson photographs never before exhibited in the UK alongside over 75 works by 14 international acclaimed photographers, this extensive showcase will illustrate how photographers working in Europe and North America adopted and adapted the master's ethos famously known as  the ‘decisive moment' to their work in colour. Though they often departed from the concept in significant ways, something of that challenge remained: how to seize something that happens and capture it in the very moment that it takes place.</p>

<p>Exhibition runs through till January 27th, 2013</p>

<p>JITKA HANZLOVA</p>

<p>In 1982 Jitka Hanzlová defected from the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia and settled in Essen in West Germany. Since then she has sought to explore her experiences through photography, producing a body of work at once poetic and truthful. Hanzlová’s photography is in constant pursuit of the relationship between the individual and the context in which he or she lives. It scrutinizes the ways in which home and surroundings indelibly shape identity. Drawing on her own life story, Hanzlová’s photographs also speak to a more universal longing for a sense of place.</p>

<p>The photographer develops her work in series, beginning with Rokytník made between 1990 and 1994, the village in Eastern Bohemia which she left a decade earlier. Of central significance to Hanzlová, Rokytník is the creative bedrock for everything that follows. Taken together, her photography constitutes an imaginative investigation of ‘belonging’, whether a commentary on the alienation of city life or the photographer’s deep identification with the mysterious northern forests. This is essentially a form of extended portraiture and Hanzlová has most recently turned to portrait photography itself, in particular exploring the potential of Renaissance archetypes.</p>

<p>This is the first major retrospective of Hanzlová’s photography over the last two decades. Emerging from her experience of two different cultures and political systems, her work is a profound meditation on European identity in a post-Cold War world.</p>

<p>TIM WALKER - STORY TELLER</p>

<p>Story Teller is a major new exhibition of work by Tim Walker – one of the most visually exciting and influential fashion photographers working today. Coinciding with a book of the same name, the exhibition features over 175 inspirational images, collages and snapshots from Walker’s personal archives. Walker turns fashion shoots into fairytales or, in his own words, ‘daydreams into photographs’. He constructs flamboyant worlds that unfold like a series of stills from unrealised films.</p>

<p>Drawn from the world’s leading magazines such as British, French, American and Italian Vogue, Vanity Fair, W and The New Yorker and with some of the biggest names in contemporary fashion and culture, witness Stella Tennant in a pink cloud among an English country garden; Agyness Deyn in the sand dunes of Namibia; Tilda Swinton in Iceland; Alexander McQueen and a memento mori of skull and cigarettes; Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton turning an Essex garden centre into a danse macabre.</p>

<p>KOBI ISRAEL - IN BETWEEN LANDS</p>

<p>The trilogy, Land Scapes, a travelogue that evolves around the mythic, nomadic nature of landscape photography, is a symbolic tale forming an epic cinematic journey. Each chapter explores psychological territories, using landscape as a stage on which to cast the themes of desire, identity and personal history whilst the spectator is encouraged to assemble clues and construct a personal narrative. The first trilogy, Promised Lands, marks the start of the journey and depicts waterfronts, mountains and beautiful woodlands symbolic of abundance and promises of love, relating to personal identities embedded in Israel’s consciousness.<br>
The second - the current exhibition - In Between Lands, represents the passage between the promised and dreamed - transitory, nomadic spaces that hang between memory and being; documenting the split of time moving simultaneously towards the future and the past, yet seemingly suspended in the present. The third and last series – still in development - Dreamed Lands, depicts landscapes that once epitomised fantasy, now lie in rot and decay; here Israel highlights that we are unable to fix memories, instead we edit, redraft and rewrite them.</p>

<p>TIM BRADLEY - CALIFORNIA DWELLING</p>

<p>This exhibition encapsulates Bradley's photography from 1978- 1981 titled California Dwelling.</p>

<p>"From 1978 to 1981, I photographed in a neighborhood that had an uncanny visual presence. The layering of ancient bungalows, postwar apartments, outdated cars, and contemporary suburban life made the place look like no one knew what decade it was. Sunlight burnished surfaces with a pastel vibrance and night brought out illuminated doorbells and impossible shadows, projecting a feeling of theatricality.<br>
The view from the sidewalk could be disarming. It seemed as though time was holding its breath to accommodate the incidental arrangements of a suburban tableau. Looking at the groundglass I often felt that I was engulfed in a virtual space rather than aiming at a subject, as if I had stumbled onto a stage set or into someone else’s memory.</p>

<p>For four years I looked and photographed. My interest was aesthetic at first, inspired by the color photography emerging during the 70s and the unexpected beauty of my surroundings. But I soon realized that I was also documenting a fragile corner of southern California that would soon be overwritten. I made prints from about one hundred negatives and put everything into storage for thirty years."</p>

<p>JULIE BLACKMON - DAY TRIPPING</p>

<p>Through a complex process involving models, a highly staged set and carefully composed tableaux, Blackmon weaves intricate stories of the complexities of everyday life in large and busy households. Blackmon is one of the most exciting photographers working today, and in this exhibition she will debut six never before seen images.</p>

<p>As the oldest of nine children, Blackmon's work has always drawn inspiration from her familial life, her extended family playing the role of both model and muse. At the same time, her work looks far back into the history of art to the paintings of the Dutch Renaissance master Jan Steen, who was known for his carefully constructed scenes of domestic chaos. However, in this newest work, we see Blackmon taking a more contemporary approach by shifting her focus to the work of the French painter, Balthus. His paintings of street scenes include many figures who seem to exist each in their own worlds - often indifferent to what is going on around them. Like Blackmon's work, they are scenes in which time stands still, a moment of anticipation before the full story unfolds and reveals how these characters' lives may, or may not intertwine.</p>

<p>ATTACHMENTS</p>

<p>Bringing together a group of young photographers who explore the depths and boundaries of the photographic medium. Widely varied in their practices, these artists add unique perspectives to their ever-expanding and mutating photographic dialog.
Using photography in new ways, especially across disciplines, each artist will present a group of works that overlap with what are traditionally the concerns of other media; whether that be cinema, the internet, publishing, sculpture, poetry, painting or curation.</p>

<p>Andrew Kuo is a multimedia artist who will show a seires of iPhone photos where he color averaged areas to make pie charts in circles on top of the photograph.</p>

<p>Asger Carlsen makes photographs that depict ruptures in reality with the insertion of illogical and highly surreal moments and distortions.</p>

<p>Jason Nocito takes analogue photographs of the world around him that look digital, or manipulates digital photos to look analogue. His long history of making photographic publications informs his editing process and presentation.</p>

<p>Jessica Eaton makes photographs of things that don’t have a real-world indexical referent.</p>

<p>Jim Mangan treats photography like a major movie shoot, taking a group of friends on a journey of self-exploration into foreign places to create his work.</p>

<p>Kate Steciw makes digital photographic compositions where she deliberately misuses technology to make objects that are reminiscent of photographs but visually resemble sculptures or collages.</p>

<p>Peter Sutherland makes unique photographic objects by printing a photo and then adhering a perforated sticker with a different photo on to the front of it.</p>

<p>Sandy Kim is a documentary photographer of the seedier side of life with her coterie of interesting looking and debaucherous friends in the tradition of Larry Clark or Nan Goldin, but updated through her blog and internet experiences.</p>

<p>Tim Barber  will present a new group of subtle and poetic photographs that continue to expand on his unique and personal visual language.</p>

<p>EWEN SPENCER - ENGLAND’S DREAMING</p>

<p>England’s Dreaming consists of a series of images taken in and around the country that encompass the artist’s profound interest in youth and street culture. This highly anticipated exhibition, shot over 15-years, examines what it means to be young in 21st century Britain, capturing the awkward moments of adolescence that are familiar to so many of us.<br>
Shot in Spencer’s signature flash photography style, the candid photos show Britain’s youth in action as they tackle the sensitive issues of dating, sex and socialising. What results is a strikingly intimate, somewhat shocking and often disturbing display of what goes on when parents are absent and youths are left to their own devices.</p>

<p>Julian Germain's In the Eye of The Street is a compelling body of work shot on loaned cameras by teenagers and kids sleeping rough in Brazil. The project is now into its 18th year and provides a record of these young lives -  most of 55 participants have died, disappeared, or are in prison. <br>

This outstanding achievement has put Cuba at the forefront of sustainable agriculture, and is recorded in a series of photo essays by Lulu Ash.<br>
In Trevor Paglen's Geographies of Seeing we see images of top-secret U.S. government sites, some shot at up to 65 miles away on a specially adapted camera.<br>
In Control Order House, 2012 Prix Pictet prize nominee Edmund Clark presents an eerie study of a house interior, occupied by a suspected terrorist. Clark is the first artist to have gained access to the home of someone living under a Home Office control order.<br>
The UK premiere of Omer Fast's film Five Thousand Feet is the Best features a former drone operator being interviewed about the controlled unmanned planes he fired at  militia in Afghanistan and Pakistan from his base in Las Vegas.<br>

<p>ED VAN DER ELSKEN - LOOK ED!</p>

<p>Annet Gelink asked the three most prominent female Dutch artists Rineke Dijkstra, Marlene Dumas, and Marijke van Warmerdam to make a selection of works by Ed van der Elsken.</p>

<p>Dijkstra, Dumas and Van Warmerdam have each made their own selection which provide interesting insights on Van der Elsken and the three artists. Jhim Lamoree: "Ed van der Elsken's photographs had a range of expression, and the selections made by Marlene Dumas, Rineke Dijkstra and Marijke van Warmerdam attest to this. Each was drawn to a different aspect of his work. They, too, observed and made choices. The connection between Ed, Marlene, Marijke and Rineke is their ability to seek out the other without losing sight of, or a sense of, themselves. They size up the world in a humane, personal manner. Their attitude is similar, but the aesthetic results of each differ entirely. The selections cause an intriguing and enigmatic doubling to occur: the show not only gives a varied portrait of Ed's oeuvre, but also a self-portrait of the oeuvres of Marlene, Marijke en Rineke."</p>

<p>ROADS TO WIGAN PIER</p>

<p>Taking as their starting point George Orwell’s seminal 1937 publication The Road to Wigan Pier, a sociological investigation into the bleak living conditions of the working class in Yorkshire and Lancashire, six newly graduated students of photography were commissioned by Impressions to record and document social aspects of the North of England. Each worked independently and each took a personal viewpoint. <BR>
These non-judgemental, yet sometimes shocking, photographs show us a way of life that was in terminal decline. This picture of Orwellian dystopia acts as an elegy of the northern urban landscape and its people, on the brink of irrevocable social and cultural change. Today, in-post industrial Britain, we are perhaps inclined to forget the recent past as many of the symbols of poverty and neglect have been replaced by regeneration.</p>

<p>MITRA TABRIZIAN - ANOTHER COUNTRY</p>

<p>Another Country is a series of 8 large-scale group and individual portraits showing real people: immigrants who have come to Europe from the Middle East, and their children, some of whom were born in the UK. The scenes are shot in everyday settings in London - a school, a café, a cemetery, but the geographic location remains ambiguous. Where is here? “In this context, which challenges the polarity of identifications, the title ‘Another Country’ no longer refers to some other country out there, but to a culture within” says the artist.</p>

<p>Mitra Tabrizian’s work explores a range of issues including post-colonial theory, corporate culture in the West and the recent cultural and political shifts in Iranian society. Blurring the boundary between fact and fiction and combining documentary techniques with those of film, she produces meticulously choreographed photographic scenes of condensed narratives.</p>

<p>ZOE LEONARD</p>

<p>Engaging many of today’s core questions around photography and image-making, and stepping back from current debates about analogue versus digital (or nostalgia versus progress), Leonard will transform one of the gallery’s spaces into a camera obscura.<br>In this embodied experience of viewing, a constantly changing panorama of 17th Street - with its mix of architecture and urban activity that reflects the immense changes in Chelsea in recent years - will project continuously on the floor, walls, and ceiling.  Neither analogue nor digital, the dark box of the camera obscura can be understood as a model for the mind and the unconscious, an apparatus that makes visible the mechanics of sight.  What happens inside resembles what transpires in one's eye:  light lands on the retina inverted and reversed, and a series of transformations occurs in the brain allowing us to comprehend the images we receive.</p>

<p>EVERYTHING WAS MOVING - FROM THE 60S AND 70S</p>

<p>This major photography exhibition surveys the medium from an international perspective, and includes renowned photographers from across the globe, all working during two of the most memorable decades of the 20th century. Everything Was Moving: Photography from the 60s and 70s brings together over 400 works, some rarely seen, others recently discovered and many shown in the UK for the first time.</p>

<p>It features 12 key figures including Bruce Davidson, William Eggleston, David Goldblatt, Graciela Iturbide, Boris Mikhailov, Sigmar Polke, Malick Sidibé, Shomei Tomatsu, and Li Zhensheng as well as important innovators whose lives were cut tragically short such as Ernest Cole, Raghubir Singh and Larry Burrows.<br>
The world changed dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s. From the Cultural Revolution to the Cold War; from America’s colonialist misadventure in Vietnam to the indelible values of the civil rights movement; this was the defining period of the modern age. It also coincided with a golden age in photography: the moment when the medium flowered as a modern art form.</p>

<p>NAOYA HATAKEYAMA - NATURAL STORIES</p>

<p>One of Japan's most prominent photographers, Naoya Hatakeyama is known for austere and beautiful large-scale pictures that capture the extraordinary forces we deploy to shape nature to our will - and, in photographs made after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, the equally powerful impact of natural forces on human construction. Whether photographing factories, quarries, mines, or his tsunami-swept hometown in northeastern Japan, Hatakeyama is a keen observer of landscapes in transition, witnessing scenes of transformation with calm precision.</p>

<p>The artist's first solo exhibition in the United States, Natural Stories brings together more than 100 photographs and two video installations spanning Hatakeyama's entire career. It offers insights into his practice and place in the rich history of Japanese photography, and into the ways in which humanity and nature both clash and coexist.</p>

<p>WILLIAM KLEIN + DAIDO MORIYAMA</p>

<p>This is the first exhibition to look at the relationship between the work of influential photographer and filmmaker Klein, and that of Moriyama, the most celebrated photographer to emerge from the Japanese Provoke movement of the 1960s.
With work from the 1950s to the present day, the exhibition demonstrates the visual affinity between their urgent, blurred and grainy style of photography and also their shared desire to convey street life and political protest, from anti-war demonstrations and gay pride marches to the effects of globalisation and urban deprivation.
The exhibition also considers the medium and dissemination of photography itself, exploring the central role of the photo-book in avant-garde photography and the pioneering use of graphic design within these publications.</p>

<p>JUERGEN TELLER - IRENE IM WALD</p>

<p>"Gebrüder Grimm, witches, the big bad wolf, the forest is one hell of a scary place, I thought. But even as a child I was drawn towards it - it was scary, but the beauty and the peacefulness of it all sucked me in."</p>

<p>Juergen Teller's images tell stories, usually they are the stories of people. For "Irene im Wald" (Irene in the Forest), Teller photographed the woods nearby the artist's childhood home near Nuremberg, Germany. Only sometimes including figures, Teller's mother Irene and other relatives, the solitary nature of the pictures in "Irene im Wald" contributes to the intimacy of this honest portrait of the forest that he grew up with, capturing its haunting and lingering personality.</p>

<p>ADAM BROOMBERG &amp; OLIVER CHANARIN</p>

<p>The title of Broomberg and Chanarin’s new solo exhibition was originally the coded phrase used by Kodak to describe the capabilities of a new film stock developed in the early 80’s to address the inability of their earlier films to accurately render dark skin.</p>

<p>Jean-Luc Godard famously refused to use Kodak film during an assignment to Mozambique in 1977, on the grounds that the film stock was inherently ‘racist’. In response to a commission to 'document' Gabon, Broomberg and Chanarin recently made several trips to the country to photograph a series of rare Bwiti initiation rituals, using only Kodak film stock that had expired in the late 1950’s. 
 Using outdated chemical processes Broomberg and Chanarin succeeded in salvaging just a single frame from the many colour rolls they exposed during their visits. It is  presented along side an array of black and white photographic tests, whose parameters were dictated to them by a deceased family friend, an anatomist and amateur photographer, Dr. Rosenberg.<br>
 The exhibition centers around a series of these partly exposed, haphazardly cropped proto-images, originally printed as test strips. The grey tones, grain and texture of black and white photographic chemistry are foregrounded in these outsized ‘darkroom’ experiments.</p>

<p>OLIVER HOLDEN - UNCERTAIN BRISTOL</p>

<p>Uncertain Bristol is an ongoing process that explores the possibility of visually representing the formation of memory through photography.
The way in which a viewer interprets discernible information in a photograph relies heavily on experience and memory. With this, one reconstructs a certain memory through thought; fragmented, multi-levelled and fluid but with information lacking at certain points. Despite this, perception attempts to fill in the information. Smell, sound and touch enters the equation, transforming the original visual memory into a multi-dimensional sensory experience. Each capture attempts to do just that. Not to "copy"what is visually seen, but to represent the atmosphere at the point of shutter close. To encourage the viewer to delve into ones memory and experience to complete the picture.</p>

<p>Uncertain Bristol focuses on the heart of Bristol's historic industrious landmarks, the docks, factories and railways. These raw materials are striking form, power and grandeur, delivered through the lens of an affected manual film camera under uncertain visceral circumstances. Once captured, the results visually emulate certain stages of memory reconstruction whilst challenging the perception of the viewer</p>

<p>DAIDO MORIYAMA - TIGHTS + LIPS</p>

<p>This latest group of pictures entitled “Tights” is the development of his famous earlier series “How to Create a Beautiful Picture 6: Tights in Shimotakaido” of 1987, a small selection of images depicting close-up shots of legs in fishnets.<br>The complete series now numbers 20. Our show coincides with a major exhibition at Tate Modern “William Klein/Daido Moriyama” which will chronicle how these two artists have influenced each other, and how they have both explored the cities of New York and Tokyo in their celebrated depictions of modern urban life.<br>
Moriyama is known for his raw, gritty gaze, his portrayal of Japan’s dark underbelly in the post-war era. His early career coincided with the seismic cultural changes in that country as it struggled to cope with the devastation wreaked by the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Moriyama voraciously devoured and regurgitated what he saw – not always intrusively, but there has certainly always been something predatory about his photography. This comes at his own admission; indeed, one of his famous, early books of 1972 is called “Hunter”. In his ceaseless wandering and photographing,  we see the artist’s faith in the journey; the idea that by virtue of searching and looking, something will be found. Moriyama inherited this philosophy from Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road”.</p>

<p>KOHEI YOSHIYUKI</p>

<p>First exhibited in Tokyo in 1979, Kohei Yoshiyuki’s (Japan, b. 1946) twin projects The Park and Love Hotel ignited furious debate about photography’s relationship with voyeurism and surveillance.</p>

<p>Yoshiyuki was a young commercial photographer in Tokyo in the early 1970s when he and a colleague walked through Chuo Park in Shinjuku one night. They noticed a couple on the ground, then spectators lurking in the bushes. Fascinated by these illicit games of cat and mouse, Yoshiyuki spent the next six months becoming a participant. “To photograph the voyeurs”, he later wrote, “I needed to be considered one of them”. Returning with his camera, loaded with infrared flashbulbs and film, he photographed in three different Tokyo parks over several years.</p>

<p>RINEKE DIJKSTRA - A RETROSPECTIVE</p>

<p>Since the early 1990s, Rineke Dijkstra has produced a complex body of photographic work, offering a contemporary take on the genre of portraiture. Her large-scale color photographs of young, typically adolescent subjects recall 17th-century Dutch painting in their scale and visual acuity. The minimal contextual details present in her photographs and videos encourage us to focus on the exchange between photographer and subject and the relationship between viewer and viewed. Rineke Dijkstra: A Retrospective brings together more than 70 photographs and five videos in a major mid-career survey, offering the most comprehensive presentation of the artist’s work to date.</p>

<p>Dijkstra works in series, creating groups of photographs and videos around a specific typology or theme. In 1992, she started making portraits of adolescents posed on beaches from Hilton Head, South Carolina, to Poland and Ukraine. Shot from a low perspective, the subjects of the Beach Portraits (1992–2002), poised on the brink of adulthood, take on a monumental presence. In contemporaneous works, including portraits of new mothers after giving birth, and photographs of bullfighters immediately after leaving the ring, Dijkstra sought subjects whose physical exhaustion diminished the likelihood of an artificed pose.</p>

<p>RICHARD MISRACH - DESERT CANTOS</p>

<p>Spanning the first 25 years of Misrach's career, the exhibition will offer a rare opportunity to track the artistic development of one of the most significant living American photographers. The chronology of the exhibition begins with the luscious split-toned works realized with a flash shot into desert night scenes. Eerie and magnificent, these works introduce many of the themes that would occupy Misrach in the years to come: staging the condition of aesthetic beauty of the natural world as mediated by human intervention in the landscape - in this case the photographer's own invasive flash. The sublime nature of the damage wrought on the landscape by man-made disasters forms the central theme of his Desert Cantos series.<br>These concerns can be further traced through the Playboy series, Battleground Point, and the dramatic views from Misrach's porch tracking meteorological conditions around San Francisco Bay's Golden Gate.
These related bodies of work secured Misrach's place as the preeminent American photographer of his generation investigating issues surrounding landscape.</p>

<p>GILES PRICE - E20 12: UNDER CONSTRUCTION</p>

<p>E2012 Under Construction  is a documentary project by Giles Price. It combines large format and minutely detailed aerial landscapes with arresting portraits of the workforce taken during the construction of the 2012 Olympic Park.</p>

<p>The aerial pictures push the boundaries of the visual language of satellite imaging, such as Google Earth. These photographs, produced with the aid of the latest camera technology, allow the viewer to experience a new way of seeing the construction of the Olympic Park with stunning detail and beauty. They reveal a previously invisible perspective on the intricacy of the landscape and the  overwhelming scale of its transformation. Conversely, the pictures of workers show us the unseen human face of those involved in the construction of the site. These engaging portraits add a personal dimension to the depiction of the transformation, and offer a glimpse into the hidden stories of the Olympic Park.</p>

<p>A book with 48 pages of full, colour, images from the project, also entitled E20 12: Under Construction, will be available from August 31st via <a href="http://www.seestudio.com/" rel="external">www.seestudio.com</a></p>

<p>HENRY HORENSTEIN</p>

<p>Concentrating on the 1970s, but spanning to the present day, Horenstein’s gritty, black-and-white photographs capture the irrepressible spirit of an American institution. Some say the 1970s were the last great decade of country music - between the pomade, plaid jackets, and goofy hillbilly jokes of the 1950s and the more polished “Urban Cowboy” sound of Nashville in the early 1980s.<br>
Horenstein’s work captures it all, from the roadside seediness of TJ’s Lounge to the backstage glamour at the Grand Ole Opry. From bluegrass festivals and country music parks to the honky tonks and dance halls, these images picture such celebrities as Dolly Parton, Jerry Lee Lewis, Waylon Jennings, up to a recent cardboard cut-out of Garth Brooks (which speaks volumes about the artist’s personal opinion of the direction the genre has taken of late). However, the photographs feature not only the stars, but also include the familiar venues and enthusiastic fans who sustain them.</p>

<p>GUY TILLIM - SECOND NATURE</p>

<p>For the past year Tillim has been photographing the landscape in French Polynesia. He was drawn to this landscape that has been continuously sketched - and later photographed - since Captain James Cook's voyages in the late 18th century, perhaps because it almost eludes convincing representation. In reading the accounts of the artists who accompanied Cook, Tillim was interested to note that their debates on-board ship around the subject of the representation of landscape are very similar to those we have today: how much do you 'give' a scene and how much do you let it speak for itself? In this regard, he explains his own difficulties in finding a way through this binary because of our strongly conditioned notions of the frame and the picturesque.</p>

<p>THERE'S SOMETHING HAPPENING HERE</p>

<p>A group exhibition showcasing the work of a new generation of photographers.
in these troubled and uncertain times of upheaval and dissent on a global scale, a new generation of 
photographers and image-makers is emerging. Steeped in the process and versed in the 
psychology of the medium, they are exploring angst, neurosis, notions of fragility and identity and 
even the subjectivity of photography itself.<br>The photographers included in the exhibition come 
from a diverse range of photographic backgrounds: from fashion and still life to conceptual photography 
and contemporary art. Despite the diversity of their practice, shared interests emerge. Their work 
challenges conventional boundaries of photography in surprising and unconventional ways, from 
appropriating found images to incorporating other media.</p>

<p>MARK POWER - BLACK COUNTRY STORIES</p>

<p>Mark Power was commissioned by Multistory to create a series of urban landscapes responding to his experience of the Black Country - an area hit particularly hard by the economic recession. For many years, Mark's work has sought to reveal the beauty of the everyday and the overlooked and there is a quiet yet simmering splendour in his photographic observations.</p>

<p>During his visits to the region, Mark noticed an array of thriving beauty salons and gentlemen's clubs peppering local shopping arcades. Investigating this further, he discovered a number of historical precedents for the success of beauty and sex industries in times of austerity.  This led to the making a series of short films shot in a beauty salons and nightclubs.</p>

<p>A further series of photographs shows elegant footwear seen from pavement level against a backdrop of grey concrete and crumbling brick, while a sound installation turns the names used to describe the colours of make-up and tattooist’s dyes into a mantra-like poem. All this serves to complement the apparent bleakness of the landscapes depicted in the large format photographs.</p>

<p>DOROTHY BOHM - SEEING AND FEELING</p>

<p>An undisputed doyenne of British photography, Dorothy Bohm has been taking pictures for over 70 years. She is one of the most productive and versatile photographers active today, with examples of her work held in public and private collections worldwide. She has published fourteen books and has had numerous one-woman exhibitions. At the age of 88, her enthusiasm for taking pictures continues unabated.</p>

<p>Bohm came to England from Lithuania in 1939 as a girl of fourteen to escape the threat of Nazism. She finished her schooling in Sussex and then studied photography at the Manchester College of Technology. She opened her own photographic studio in Manchester at the age of 21, soon making a name for herself as a portrait photographer.<br>
Frequent visits to the Swiss Lakes soon after the war stimulated her interest in outdoor photography. Impressed by the different quality of light and encouraged by a number of well-known painters and sculptors, she soon exchanged studio portraiture for images of the human figure in its infinite diversity and in its natural environment.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s, encouraged by Andre Kertesz, Dorothy Bohm began experimenting with colour polaroids and found that she no longer wished to photograph in black and white. While her work continued to express her profoundly humane approach to the world, colour gave her the means to pursue her fascination with reflections and surfaces, allowing for a witty exploration of spatial ambiguity, even occasionally verging on abstraction.</p>

<p>JEAN-LUC MYLAYNE</p>

<p>In his solo exhibition, Mylayne is presenting works which, through changing lines of vision onto nature, give rise to various levels for perceiving time. In a series of photographs, Mylayne focuses intensively on the reconstruction of observation as a temporal movement. In these pictures, he often does not present the birds at the center, but as tiny figures within the landscape.</p>

<p>They are cut off by the frame, appear blurred, or have already flown away from the pictorial segment. Mylayne often sets the horizon of the landscape very low, so that the sky becomes the dominant background. He repeats a view leading from the ground to a high altitude, just like the flying motion of the birds. In the photographs No. 268, No. 269, and No. 270, all of which were created between February and March 2004, he shows three successively altered views of the same tree. In the photographs, there are respective modifications in the perspectives of a bird sitting on a branch, in the exposure to light, and in the color of the sky, until the tree in the foreground of No. 270 is no longer in focus, and only diffuse shadows indicate the presence of the bird.</p>

<p>The pictures acquire the quality of stills which, as individual images, evoke a filmic succession or an ongoing pictorial sequence. In a subtle fashion, as in No. 284, Février - Mars 2004, Mylayne ushers such traces and equipment of human beings into recognizability in the background as a fence, a wood saw, or a windwheel. The indication of human presence sets a dynamic oscillation between presence and absence in motion, which is repeated in the constantly changing positions of the animals. As in a puzzle picture, the viewer is required to reconstruct Mylayne's scenes and can recognize the birds with a groping, gliding gaze only after a certain time.</p>

<p>Over the course of a year Simon Roberts travelled England in a motor home, training his large format 4x5” plate camera on people and places across the country.  His richly detailed largescale photographs provide a vivid and elegiac account of modern England. Showing people playing golf in the shadow of a power station, enjoying a picnic at the side of the road or congregating en masse on a sandy beach, the photographs in We English explore issues of
identity, belonging and the relationship between a people and their land.<br>
We English is a very personal work, drawing on Roberts' childhood memories, his engagement with the tradition of British photographic work from Bill Brandt to Paul Graham, and his journey across the country. It is also a shared vision, informed by the public participation that Roberts encouraged during his journey via his website</p>

<p>ANTHONY HAUGHEY - SETTLEMENT</p>

<p>Settlement explores the effects of economic growth on the natural landscape. Even in the smallest rural villages and towns private developers and credit rich individuals availed of favourable government tax breaks and laissez faire planning legislation to hastily build domestic housing estates for quick profit and to meet the demands of a growing population.</p>

<p>All the photographs in this series are produced between sunset and sunrise, partly to avoid any potential confrontation with security guards who regularly patrol these sites during the daytime. The combination of darkness, artificial light and long exposures draws attention to the effects of development on the natural environment by reducing each photograph to the key elements of land and manmade constructions. The natural landscape has been disturbed by earth moving machinery generating artificial hills and valleys in front of half built or unoccupied dwellings. Slowly, nature has started to reclaim the exposed landscape.</p>

<p>JOEY L - CRADLE OF MANKIND</p>

<p>Shot in Ethiopia’s Omo Valley, and featuring portraits of the various tribes that inhabit the area, the photographs are a deeply moving, visual homage to the tribal peoples of Ethiopia, the birthplace of Homo sapiens.</p>

<p>The photographs from Cradle of Mankind, along with Joey L.’s documentary film, Faces of a Vanishing World - which first aired on Ovation TV in September 2010, chronicle the artist’s deep interest in Ethiopia, and the rapid transition of it’s oldest cultures. During his time in the country, Joey L. lived with various tribes in the region, learning the different customs of each while capturing individual portraits. Though these tribes may seem untouched by time, they are in fact in constant danger of disappearing forever. The artist states in a 2010 NPR interview that he is interested in anthropology and likes photographing different cultures, “[b]ut the ones I’ve been paying attention to lately are the, I suppose what you’d call vanishing ones, ... the cultures that are on the verge of extinction, tribes that are threatened by progress and losing their language and losing their ways of life that they’ve sustained for thousands of years.”</p>

<p>MUZI QUAWSON - SHAWMUT CIRCLE</p>

<p>Shawmut Circle is named after a local playground which functions as the favorite skate site for Cody, one of the film's central characters. The work consists of a series of fragmented vignettes that are set on three screens, and show glimpses of the daily lives of a group of adolescents and grown ups in City of Valley, USA. Muzi Quawson spent several months in this marginalized community on the border of Georgia and Alabama and created a complex, atmospheric portrait of the lives she encountered.</p>

<p>Quawson manages to catch the tranquility of small town life where the girl at the cash desk casually shares family news with a passerby and kids make out in the parking lot. The elderly "Bullet" takes us on a bike ride through the black community and tells us how he got his name. We also meet Cody, the young skater whose appearance clearly sets him apart from his peers. And there is Henry, who sings a hymn to us in the back of his grocery shop/gas pump.<br>
 Although the work does not aim to be a sociological document, it is full of references to the cultural background of the American Deep South. "Bullet's" recollections of his work at the cotton mills refer to the time when "cotton was king" - a time long gone. The slow-pace of life, especially that of the youth depicted, tells us of the recession the area had to face since the decline of American textile industries. The clear geographical separation between the black and the white characters documents the racial segregation that was practiced well into the 1970s in Georgia.</p>

<p>ZOE STRAUSS: 10 YEARS, A SLIDESHOW</p>

<p>This slideshow marks the culmination of Strauss’ I-95 project, a ten year long endeavor for 
which Strauss displayed her photographs by affixing them to the pilasters supporting the overpass of 
Interstate-95 in South Philadelphia.   The slideshow featured at the gallery is the artist’s final selection of the images she created for this project over the last decade.<BR>
For a single day each May (from 2001-2010), Strauss revitalized and transformed a derelict and 
unused public space into a site for art, facilitating community and social interaction through her 
installation.  At the end of the exhibit, the laminated installation photographs were free for the taking.   As an artist, Strauss prioritizes accessibility and she enthusiastically promotes discourse regarding her work and artistic process via her well-known and widely followed blog.   She describes her work as an effort to create an “epic narrative that reflects the beauty and struggle of 
everyday life.” <BR>While her chosen subjects and scenes of the American urban landscape can 
seem unflattering, troubling or blighted, they reflect the artist’s interest in confronting and depicting life in America, not in a manner of pure social journalism, but as a method of exploring her interests in visual abstraction as well as the self-reflexive nature of the medium.  The viewer is challenged to question his or her response to Strauss’ depiction of our cultural climate via the signs, streets, storefronts and portraits that comprise it.</p>

<p>PROM: PHOTOGRAPHS BY MARY ELLEN MARK</p>

<p>Between 2006 and 2009, American photographer Mary Ellen Mark visited thirteen high school proms to create portraits of attendees with a 20-by-24-inch Polaroid Land Camera. Only five such cameras exist, and they make extraordinary and unique large-format prints. Mark used the camera previously for her 2003 project Twins, and in Prom she applies it to the quintessential American coming-of-age ritual, selecting high schools from across the country that reflect the regional and class differences among Americans. Approximately sixty of Mark’s portraits are included in the exhibition, demonstrating the egalitarian spirit of her project and the continuing democratic potential of photography.</p>

<p>ERIC MARRIAN - CARRE BLANC</p>

<p>The series was an immediate success when first shown in 2005. Eric Marrian was clearly recognized as being original in the way he portrays the body and deals with the universal but difficult genre of nude photography.</p>

<p>'Carré Blanc' represents a new approach, which is sometimes endearing, always sharp and exacting, and designed to amuse. Marrian looks with the eye of the architect and celebrates the science of volumes and the geometry of bodies for the eye of a modern-day public that knows no taboos.<BR>
Above all, he shows a new body, shaped by the lens, a body he sees and reveals like the parts of a large puzzle and approaches like a playground; a body that is never shown in its entirety but in segments, fragmented, as if hewn from stone and usually pale in complexion. In short, a ludic, sculptural, exalted and self-sufficient body. 
Part of the charm of ‘Carré Blanc’ derives from the fact that the series constitutes a humorous and poetic grammar of sensual elements, with imaginary landscapes and unexpected reliefs. They describe a region that is both familiar and untrodden. 
With Marrian the female body, the photographic subject par excellence, is stripped of eroticism. It is tangible but pared down to all but the essentials. He chooses the game and the allegory, he celebrates the metaphors of the flesh. There is nothing obscene about exploring a body which has been taken apart and put together again, which with its intellectual games, charades and spiritual landscapes sometimes closely resembles the world of the surrealists.<BR>
It is also a spiritualized body, which hints at the presence of things and the spirit of the work behind the physical frame. The photographs give the woman’s body the sort of depth, density and texture that is rare with nude photographers. Curves which escape and spill out into melodies or into interrupted arabesques and broken lines, studies of curvatures and creases, hands and forearms folded over supple flesh, etc. Replete with nooks and angles, sections and perspectives, this body follows some secret geometric pattern</p>

<p>WILLIAM ECKERSLEY - DARK CITY</p>

<p>Dark City offers a stark contrast to the glossy marketing of Olympic fervour with a documentary-style photographic presentation capturing London’s less watched moments.
Eckersley has, with Becher-esque discipline, spent four years photographing car parks, industrial plants, underpasses and council estates, working only in the pitch black of night, armed with his (5x4 tungsten- balanced Fujifilm). The exhibition, and the accompanying publication, is the product of this work.</p>

<p>Eckersley’s acute awareness of the contrasts between the street halogen lights and the looming darkness have led him to be described as a “master of light”, and in his continued investigation of the built environment and de-peopled cityscapes he has developed a recognisable style similar to the Düsseldorf school with its vivid colours and stringent German precision.<br>
But if the aesthetic is German, then the scene is most certainly London. Locals may recognize a scene inside the underground, a shot beside the canal, or a view on a bridge. Indeed the body of work can be seen as a typology of London space at night, though in Eckersley’s London he captures moments so quiet, so perfectly static, that they could be likened to film sets. Stranded shopping trollies appear choreographed, and stacked tyres are so poised as to be deliberately placed. Even the most throwaway arrangement suddenly becomes loaded with intent. In fact it is hard to imagine a London like this, so different to the bustling reality of everyday life. But in capturing these moments Eckersley has created a new reality, a reality that, whilst eerie, may yet become more attractive in the raucous hubbub of the Olympic Games.</p>

<p>ANDREA MODICA - BEST FRIENDS</p>

<p>With her recent series, Best Friends, Andrea Modica took her 8x10 camera into high schools in the US and Italy for a compelling group of photographs of young men and women. The project began as individual portraits, but it quickly developed into photographs of two students together. As several of the subjects arrived for their appointment with a companion, Modica readily saw that the two friends offered something much more interesting than the single figure. The interaction between the friends, the physical and fashion similarities/contrasts, and the way the students reacted to Modica, provided an opportunity to look at friendship and sense of self among adolescents today, as well as how they differ between countries. Capitalizing on the slow, interactive nature of 8x10 portraiture, Modica was able</p>

<p>to penetrate some of the defensive masks and behaviors of the students to show fragments of who they are as friends and individuals. Beyond the obvious surface information (physical opposites drawn together; mirrored pairs who have found each other), Modica’s images let us see things like the bravado which has slipped for one boy, yet remains intact for his friend, or the defensive, protective pose one girl takes on behalf of the other. Notably, Modica is able to reveal elements of the personal, which elevate the pictures well beyond social observation. The subjects engage us as individuals, and through that connection we are briefly drawn into the complexity, anxiety and excitement of adolescent life.</p>

<p>INTA RUKA - THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER</p>

<p>For three decades now, Inta Ruka has been producing various series in which she portrays with characteristic empathy the people from rural and urban areas alike. To this end, she directs her gaze exclusively towards her fellow countrymen. She works with a 1937 6x6cm Rolleiflex aided by a tripod, but foregoes the use of artificial lighting.</p>

<p>The photographer meets her subjects outside their homes either at random or during arranged meetings, on the street, in courtyards or gardens. As a result, increasing familiarity triggers changes in the environment, in which the portrait is taken. Her subjects’ living conditions often play a decisive role in Inta Ruka’s photographs and simultaneously allow for an assessment of their personal relationship. Notwithstanding this aspect, the artist tends to opt for full-length portraits, semi-long shots, or close-ups. And so, the artist creates highly atmospheric silver-gelatine prints in 35 x 33 cm. For the most part, Ruka positions her subjects in a similar way to the Old Masters, namely at the centre of the frame. Despite their calm pose, sitting or standing, it still seems like a conversation had been taking place at the moment the photograph was shot.<br>The beholder’s mistaken gaze, in combination with Inta Ruka’s personal dairy entries, which she has written on the walls beneath the photos in the exhibition, not only afford insights into the subject’s external surroundings but into their inner world too. Ruka’s sensitive, time-consuming, yet calm working process allows the masterful artist make staged photos appear completely spontaneous.</p>

<p>ÁLVARO LAIZ - TRANSMONGOLIAN</p>

<p>The Secret History of the Mongols, considered to be the oldest Mongolian language literary work, is the single significant native account of Mongolia's rise to power around the 12th century AD. Providing a clear narration of the vicissitudes that brought a disperse land of nomads to become the greatest domination in Asia, the work paints a clear portrait of the journey taken by a young Temuiin before transforming into, the great ruler of Asia, Genghis Khan.</p>

<p>Blended with fictional and historical accounts, the epic poetry and narrative, recounts how the warrior was able to organize more than thirty tribes battling for control, and how once in power, with the objective to augment his population and face his enemies, declared homosexuality illegal under death penalty.</p>

<p>Today, more than eight hundred years later, Mongolia is a sovereign country with the lowest population rate in the world, lower than two inhabitants per square kilometre and being a homosexual, continues to be taboo. The weight of tradition and the years under Soviet control, a time in which homosexuals were sent to gulag, surmise a ballast for gays, lesbians, and transsexuals, who continue to be repressed, rejected, and victimized. Condemned to a life of secrecy, many of them find themselves turning to prostitution, others lead a life of solitude. The younger wrestle to flee the Mongolian borders, to countries such as the Philippines or Japan, where their 'condition' is much more tolerable and dreams of a sex change are attainable, but above all, to an identity which in their native land, has been denied way too long.</p>

<p>ANDY WARHOL - PHOTOGRAPHS &amp; SCREEN TESTS</p>

<p>Warhol was extremely productive as a photographer. Especially in the 1970s and 1980s a significant body of gelatin silver prints was created, taken with a variety of compact automatic- and instant cameras. Easy to handle, they offered the opportunity to capture a candid picture at any given time or place. The resulting photographs chronicle the general public life as well as the artist’s personal obsessions and depict the USA as a country of contradictions.<br>
His photographs draw on the democratic equality of subjects in his paintings, emphasizing Warhol’s pronounced attention to current events and his attempt to dissolve the border between art and commercialism. They feature recurring subjects such as newspaper boxes, displays in shop windows, curiosities, stereotypical images, but also the reality of social differences and poverty. Those scenes of everyday life represent the American Way of Life, which in Warhol’s photographs culminates to a distinct iconography and an eloquent portrayal of America.</p>

<p>A selection of twelve Screen Tests complements the current exhibition of Warhol’s filmic and photographic work. Originally, so-called screen tests are test takes of actors, which the artist developed into his very own and specific form of experimental films. The subjects of these short films are portraits of his staff members, friends and visitors at the Factory, among them the musicians Bob Dylan and Lou Reed, the actors Dennis Hopper and Baby Jane Holzer, the artists Marcel Duchamp and Paul Thek, and many more. Oscillating between the credibility and the mediated nature of an individual “image“, these cinematic portraits became fascinating documents of contemporary history, of important figures of public life, of the media, and the cultural scene.</p>

<p>BRUNO CALS - HORIZONS</p>

<p>In the words of the curator, Boris Kossoy: “In his  Horizons work, Bruno Cals 
presents a reflection on space and time: landscapes from other worlds and 
possibly extinct (or still unborn?) civilizations, not necessarily human. How do 
our minds react to the unknown?  To empty landscapes, without historical clues?
Cals shows us mostly places that are apparently abandoned; places without 
any trace of humans or other forms of life; a few exceptions, however, surprise us 
for containing possible high-tech landscapes that could imply the presence of 
advanced worlds: space stations, artificial cities? In these images we search 
for the air, we hear the silence. We reflect on infinite distances and immemorial 
times. This is the journey of a photographer who finds, in the appearance of 
things, only the starting point.</p>

<p>To commemorate the centennial of the birth of photographer, filmmaker, musician, and writer Gordon Parks, this show encompasses a large-scale photo mural and slideshow of more than 50 photographs he captured throughout his long, illustrious career.
Three video screens will display his stunning images, which explore such issues as urban and rural poverty, racism and prejudice, politics, and the historic Civil Rights Movement.<br>
“As we celebrate Gordon Parks’ life we also celebrate his legacy as a humanitarian with a deep commitment to social justice,” said Dr. Maurice Berger, Guest Curator. “The body of work he left behind documents many of the most important aspects of American culture from the early 1940s up until his death in 2006.”</p>

<p>FIONA CRISP</p>

<p>Generated at the National Trust site of Stourhead (Wiltshire, UK) in 2006, the images eschew any desire to document a specific location; instead, the historic house at Stourhead, along with it’s world-famous 18th century landscape gardens, are employed by Crisp as a formal device to reflect upon the colliding imperatives of heritage, leisure and history at a site of national cultural significance.</p>

<p>Implicit are questions concerning the democratising of cultural ‘assets’ or the space between the public and private sphere but ideas are also articulated through a formal visual language where tensions are set up between proximity and distance, between the flat plane of the photograph and the perspectival depth of landscape or between revealing and obscuring a ‘view’.</p>

<p>The phrase Negative Capability was first used by the Romantic Poet John Keats in 1817 when, in a letter to his brother, he identified the ability to accept uncertainty and the unresolved as prerequisite for creativity. The relationship between knowledge and doubt has long been at the heart of Crisp's practice and is often reflected in her work's wilful instability as it oscillates between illusionistic space and explicit, functional presence.</p>

<p>RALPH GIBSON</p>

<p>The solo exhibition featuring more than 60 photographs gives insight into the impressive body of work of the artist who, together with Garry Winogrand, Diane Arbus and others, is among the seminal historic figures who shaped the New York photography scene. Without a doubt, Ralph Gibson is one of the groundbreaking exponents of photographic art and is known above all for his visual mixing of different styles within the medium of photography.</p>

<p>The exhibition will show works from the photographic oeuvre of Ralph Gibson that have been created over a period of 40 years - from the mystic-surrealistic photographs taken from the world-famous series The Somnambulist and works from his series Deja-Vu and Days at Sea, to his recent nudes. Within Ralph Gibson’s body of work, the connecting characteristics of his visual concepts are a pronounced use of powerful black and white contrasts and a distinguishing graininess of the silver gelatine prints. The diversity of motives and subjects does not dampen the mysterious aura inherent in the photographs, blurring the lines between realism, surrealism, expressionism and metaphysic imagery.</p>

<p>NANCY HOLT - PHOTOWORKS</p>

<p>This exhibition includes major photographic projects, including early work such as Concrete Visions, 1967; an important project made on Dartmoor while visiting the UK with her husband the late Robert Smithson over forty years ago, Trail Markers, 1969; a series of photographs of dilapidated graves in the American west, Western Graveyards; and photographs by the artist of her most famous work, Sun Tunnels, 1973 – 76 among others.</p>

<p>For more than four decades, Nancy Holt has created an extensive body of work comprised of audiotapes, videos,photographs, site-specific installations, artist’s books and major sculpture commissions around the world: most famously the Sun Tunnels, four large concrete tunnels, 18ft long and 9ft in diameter, based in the Utah desert in the US. The tunnels are aligned in pairs along an axis of the rising and setting sun on a summer or winter solstice; they act as viewing devices for the sky, the surrounding landscape and each other. Holt’s primary aesthetic and social interests converge in this work: they reflect her determination to ‘connect people with the planet earth’, to bring ‘the sky down to earth’ and to render the vast spaces of the desert ‘back down to human scale’. Her work draws attention to the cyclical time of the universe, the daily axial rotation of the Earth and its annual orbit around the sun.</p>

<p>The key themes throughout all her projects are memory, perception, time and space. She uses the natural environment as both medium and subject. Photography has always played a central role within her work, both as a way of engaging with the landscape and as a way of documenting site-specific projects.</p>

<p>EDGAR MARTINS - THE WAYWARD LINE</p>

<p>The photographs of Edgar Martins go beyond the mere image and referent on which they are based. By becoming reflexive and self-critical, they escape the scope of the purely photographic without relinquishing its essence. We can consider them to exist in a hybrid terrain, with affinities not only to painting (apparent in the idea of tableaux and the importance that he grants to composition) but also, to cinema ( plateaux ) and even to sculpture, through the way in which they establish themselves as images-objects. This last characteristic causes them to resemble characters in a quasi-absurd or nonsensical narrative and recalls the ready-mades of the Dadaists and Surrealists. The elements of the bizarre that we discover in these images (in which humans and animals rarely appear) are proof of this theory, helping to establish a sense of distance in the observer, who distrusts what he sees but surrenders to it through a sort of suspension of disbelief (Coleridge) that raises questions in his mind: “Is this a real place or one fabricated by the artist? Could we be immersed in an F for Fake kind of world?”</p>

<p>The theatricality and artificiality of these images, which oscillate between the real and the imaginary, bring them closer to the notion of the fantastic via a certain familiar strangeness that imbues the episode in front of us with suspense . Rather than being random images, chosen according to chance, they stem from a process of conceptual idealization undertaken by the artist, who, like a scientist, makes a prior and careful study of the arrangement of the elements, which are placed in a highly elaborate compositive order.</p>

<p>CHRISTER STROMHOLM - LES AMIES DE PLACE BLANCHE</p>

<p>Christer Strömholm (1918–2002) was one of the great photographers of the 20th century, but he is little known outside of his native Sweden. This exhibition presents his most powerful and acclaimed body of work: Les Amies de Place Blanche, a documentation of transsexual "ladies of the night" in Paris in the 1960s. Arriving in Paris in the late 1950s, Strömholm settled in Place Blanche in the heart of the city's red-light district.<br>There, he befriended and photographed young transsexuals struggling to live as women and to raise money for sex-change operations. Strömholm's surprisingly intimate portraits and lush Brassaï-like night scenes form a magnificent, dark, and at times quite moving photo album, a vibrant tribute to these girls, the "girlfriends of Place Blanche." The photographs were first published in Sweden in 1983, and the book quickly sold out, becoming a cult classic; it is being reissued in French and English this year. Strömholm's photo-essay raises profound issues about sexuality and gender; as he wrote in 1983, "It was then and still is about obtaining the freedom to choose one's own life and identity."</p>

<p>LISA KERESZI - THE PARTY'S OVER</p>

<p>Continuing her investigation of escapist and fantastical spaces, Kereszi has trained her eye on the gritty, abandoned sites of former amusement parks, strip clubs, theaters, and other entertainment locales. The works offer subtle visual hints of a once happier existence, using windows and reflections, for example, as metaphorical portals to escape a reality of decay.</p>

<p>Though subdued in tone and content, the work is also a celebration of the magic of the purely photographic. Reactive, though quiet, Kereszi’s photos are not pre-conceived or planned out, but rather genuine, instinctive responses to strange, silent and secret beauty. In Topless bar reflected in puddle, Doylestown, PA, Kereszi frames a sliver of the defunct club’s sign in a parking lot puddle, which forms the shape of an arrow and reflects the club’s essential message, Topless Motel Bar Food. The building’s A-frame roof and chimney suggest that this is a former home converted to a strip club, another subtle reminder of the distressed conditions to which Kereszi lends her poetic sensibility.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Kereszi’s compositions are more direct in their message, as in the show’s title image, The Party’s Over, Disco ball in box, CT, which peers down upon a shabby cardboard box containing a disco ball, no longer spinning overhead, and therefore bereft of its former power to entice. And Plastic Shark in lake behind sports bar, Pocono Mountains, PA, which reveals a comically placed shark head jutting out of shallow water, its toothy mouth agape, a sad, static reminder of a once popular recreational playground cast aside.</p>

<p>GEORGE SCHUMACHER - POLAROIDS</p>

<p>Schumacher, a psychiatrist working in central and northern California, originally considered photography a hobby. He became immersed in the Polaroid medium because of its immediacy as well as its ability to express “deep inner reflection through light and framed subject.” A chance meeting with Ansel Adams in the mid-1950s led to Schumacher’s participation in several of the Yosemite Workshops led by Adams. Adams thought so highly of his protégé’s work that he featured his images in the 1963 publication: Polaroid Land Photography Manual. This technical handbook served to acquaint and instruct photographers on the creative use of this revolutionary new photographic process. It included works by Adams, as well as such early Polaroid practitioners as Paul Caponigro, Minor White, Marie Cosindas, Philippe Halsman and Schumacher.</p>

<p>Schumacher’s success in capturing intimate, delicate, and quiet images led to exhibitions and reproduction in various art and photographic publications including Aperture, Art in America, and Infinity, among others. Aperture magazine, perhaps the most influential photography publication at the time, included Schumacher’s work as early as 1961.</p>

<p>ZED NELSON - LOVE ME</p>

<p>The exhibition explores a new form of globalisation, where an increasingly narrow Western beauty ideal is being exported around the world like a crude universal brand. Whilst Nelson's subjects appear willing participants in an omnipresent culture of bodily improvement, they might equally be considered hapless victims - at the mercy of larger social forces and locked into an insatiable craving for approval.<br>As the subject's frailties and pretensions are exposed, so too are we the viewer: our motives for looking, for inspecting, along with uncomfortable reminders of our own vanities and insecurities.</p>

<p>RICHARD AVEDON - MURALS &amp; PORTRAITS</p>

<p>In his large-scale murals and the smaller, related portraits of the 1960s and 1970s, Avedon sought to depict the spirit of the times. The transgendered Candy Darling and the naked Taylor Mead testify to the provocative countercultural behavior of the Factory; the positioning of characters within the mural suggest a complicated group dynamic. The spirit of political rebellion is embodied by the Chicago Seven mural, as well as the individual photos of writer Jean Genet, Weatherman leader Bernardine Dohrn, and former turf gang-turned-human rights group, the Young Lords.</p>

<p>The expanding definition of the American family is represented by the mural of the Ginsbergs, while earlier images of Allen in nude embrace with his partner Peter Orlovsky, were found to be too shocking for most publications in 1963. Finally, the war administrators - the Mission Council - are juxtaposed with victims of the war: Vietnamese survivors of napalm attacks. Powerful and dynamic, Avedon's images became icons of their embattled times that resonate for the present and future.</p>

<p>FREDERICK WILFRED - LONDON PHOTOGRAPHS 1957-62</p>

<p>Although little known, Wilfred (1925-2010) was a professional photographer specialising in portraiture, for which he won numerous awards. But, from the late-50s till the mid-60s, he made a series of remarkable documentary photographs of London street life. The Museum of London acquired the archive of 134 street images in 2011.</p>

<p>The photographs display something of the nostalgic charm familiar to post-Second World War photography. Nevertheless, they form a poignant portrait of a society slowly emerging from the effects of the Second World War. Amongst the works on display are shots of the now lost Twickenham Lido, street-sweepers and news-vendors, and the iconic Battersea Power Station pouring smoke from all four chimneys.</p>

<p>BEDWYR WILLIAMS - MY BAD</p>

<p>My Bad draws its title from an American vernacular phrase for admitting fault. The exhibition is comprised largely of newly commissioned installation and sculptural pieces, marking a departure from the artist’s previous concerns with Wales and ‘Welshness’.</p>

<p>Williams observes the world with a sharp eye and wry humour. His work includes a wide range of media, including performance, sculpture, painting and photography. Drawing on his own personal narratives and family histories – from school days in a North Wales farming community to his experiences as an artist-in-residence – Williams has become known for sculpture and performance work reflecting on rural life, loss, memory and the folly of ambition.</p>

<p>TARYN SIMON</p>

<p>This exhibition is the U.S. premiere of Taryn Simon's (b. 1975, New York) photographic project A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters I–XVIII. The work was produced over a four-year period (2008–11), during which the artist travelled around the world researching and documenting bloodlines and their related stories. In each of the 18 “chapters” that make up the work, external forces of territory, power, circumstance, or religion collide with the internal forces of psychological and physical inheritance. The subjects Simon documents include victims of genocide in Bosnia, test rabbits infected with a lethal disease in Australia, the first woman to hijack an aircraft, and the living dead in India. Her collection is at once cohesive and arbitrary, mapping the relationships among chance, blood, and other components of fate.</p>

<p>Simon's project is divided into 18 chapters, nine of which will be presented at MoMA. Each chapter is comprised of three segments: one of a large portrait series depicting bloodline members (portrait panel); a second featuring text (annotation panel); and a third containing photographic evidence (footnote panel).</p>

<p>ANTON CORBIJN - INWARDS AND ONWARDS</p>

<p>The large-format portraits featured in the exhibition »Inwards and Onwards« testify to the substantial body of artistic work that Anton Corbijn has created.<br>Apart from striking photographs of true music legends such as Bruce Springsteen, Patti Smith or Tom Waits, who have always fascinated Corbijn, the photographer has focussed in his recent work on modern personifications of artistic inspiration such as Marlene Dumas, Gilbert &amp; George or Jeff Koons. Working only in black and white with a Hasselblad camera, Anton Corbijn aims to reduce his photo shoots to the essential. He uses his subjects’ familiar environments as settings and works on his own with available light - assistants or artificial lighting are off-limits for him. Corbijn understands the camera as a means to an end - ultimately, he tries to capture the personality and the character hidden deep within the person portrayed beyond any kind of superficial staging although some playfulness is sometimes apparent as with Damien Hirst’s photograph and that of Jeff Koons.</p>

<p>RENE BURRI - LARGER THAN LIFE</p>

<p>Having worked for the prestigious Magnum agency since 1982, producing some of the most iconic photographs of our age. The Swiss photographer’s work has been collected and exhibited worldwide as well as being in nearly every major magazine for over the last 60 years. Larger than Life features René Burri’s most iconic and celebrated works presented for the first time in a monumental size and limited edition.</p>

<p>Born in Zurich in 1933, Burri studied design and composition, and worked as a documentary filmmaker before turning to photography during military service. In 1955 Burri had made his first contact with Magnum through Werner Bischof, when his first reportage was on deaf-mute children, which was published in LIFE as well as other European magazines. Henri Cartier-Bresson famously sent Burri away to work on a defining body of work. The resulting work was taken over a six month period, which was a photographic poem on the life of Gauchos on the Argentinian Pampas, which consequently cemented his membership of Magnum in 1959. Burri was 26 when eventually Gauchos was published in 1968. He achieved international recognition with the publication of Die Deutschen (The Germans) in 1962 displaying a powerful portrait of a changing nation in the immediate aftermath of World War II, in the style of Robert Frank’s Americans, at a time when the memory of the war and the consequences of defeat were still evident and recovery was just beginning.</p>

<p>The photographs made by Timothy H. O’Sullivan as part of the United States Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel, or King Survey, comprise an iconic and richly varied body of work.</p>

<p>The first of the great post-Civil War Western expeditions, the King Survey was organized under the authority of the U.S. Army Topographical Engineers. Between 1867 and 1872, Clarence King, the geologist in charge, and his party studied a vast swath of terrain, approximately 100 by 800 miles, encompassing the path of the soon-to-be-completed transcontinental railroad, from the border of California eastward to Cheyenne, Wyoming.</p>

<p>In four seasons with King’s group - 1867, 1869 and 1872 - he created a diverse body of photographs: geological studies, landscapes, views of miners and mining operations, records of cities and settlements, studies of the survey itself and self-reflexive meditations on his own presence in the West.</p>

<p>BURKE + NORFOLK - PHOTOGRAPHS FROM AFGHANISTAN</p>

<p>In October 2010, Simon Norfolk began a series of new photographs in Afghanistan, which takes its cue from the work of nineteenth-century Irish photographer John Burke (c. 1843-1900).   Burke was the first photographer to make pictures in Afghanistan. He accompanied British forces during the invasion that became the Second Anglo-Afghan War from 1878-1880, producing albums of prints for sale.  Virtually unknown today, Burke was a precursor of the contemporary photo-journalist producing work that went beyond reportage. His images do not reinforce British colonial values, but allow for a critical and nuanced reading of the relationship between the British forces and their Afghan peers.</p>

<p>Simon Norfolk (b. 1963) is a landscape photographer whose work over the last ten years has been themed around a probing and stretching of the meaning of the word ‘battlefield’ in all its forms. Norfolk’s photographs re-imagine or respond to Burke’s Afghan war scenes in the context of the contemporary conflict. Conceived as a collaborative project with Burke across time, this body of work by Simon Norfolk is presented alongside John Burke’s images. Rather than artificially restaging Burke’s compositions exactly, Norfolk identified contemporary equivalents, researching and travelling to Burke’s vantage points and developing a digital equivalent of his collodion wet plate technique. Norfolk finds many of the original locations of Burke’s work and conveys modern parallels with their subject matter depicting soldiers, bomb-sites, tented communities, alongside images of contemporary culture such as internet cafés and radar stations.</p>

<p>IKEA KNÄPPA CARDBOARD DIGITAL CAMERA</p>

<p>Designed by Jesper Kouthoofd, the recyclable camera is made out of one piece of folded cardboard which is secured by two plastic screws. A single circuit board holds all the electronics, camera sensor and integrated USB connector. There is a combined on/off and shutter button on the front – holding it down for a few seconds turns the KNÄPPA on or off and a “firm click” takes a photo.</p>

<p>The performance of the KNÄPPA isn’t likely to worry the likes of Nikon or Canon. It shoots decidedly lo-fi images (think a 2004 camera-phone) and IKEA jokes about the lack of functions in the promo video below – to use the “zoom function” you simply extend your arms, and “advanced image stabilization” involves resting the resting the camera on a chair.</p>

<p>Once 40 photos have been taken, users plug the 2.3 megapixel camera – billed as “the world’s cheapest digital camera” – into a USB port and transfer the images in the normal manner. Images can then be deleted from the camera by using a paperclip to press the delete button on the front for about five seconds.”</p>

<p>ALEX PRAGER - COMPULSION</p>

<p>Inspired by the photography of Weegee and Enrique Metinides, and films such as Metropolis and Un Chien Andalou, Compulsion confirms Prager’s vivid cinematic aesthetic. Unlike her previous work, however, the protagonists remain anonymous and distant. Prager’s new series investigates the complexity of observation within a society inundated by compulsive spectators, as well as the recurrent discourse in photography, that “meaning” is often derived from a multiplicity of gazes.</p>

<p>In addition to provocative juxtapositions, Prager manipulates the scenes through her choice of cropping, continually interrogating the truth content within photography, a trope as old as the medium itself.  As artist John Baldessari has noted: “For most of us photography stands for the truth, but a good artist can make a harder truth by manipulating forms…It fascinates me how (one) can manipulate the truth so easily by the way (you) juxtapose opposites or crop the image or take it out of context.” Prager’s altered and manufactured scenes, in conjunction with the evocative eyes remove, the images from their original context and allow them to aquire new associations.</p>

<p>PATRICK LICHFIELD - NUDES</p>

<p>Patrick Lichfield (1939-2005) was an internationally renowned photographer who worked for all the major magazines, exhibited worldwide, and published several books during his career. The National Portrait Gallery dedicated a retrospective exhibition to the first twenty years of his work in 2002.<br>His great break was when he was summoned by Diana Vreeland, the doyenne of fashion editors, to photograph the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and given a five year contract with American Vogue. In 1981 he was appointed official photographer at the wedding of his cousin, The Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer. He is lesser known for his nude work which will be exhibited for the first time.</p>

<p>RYAN MCGINLEY - ANIMALS</p>

<p>Animals consists of McGinley's color studio portraits of live animals with nude models. The exhibition is his first made up exclusively of selections from this growing, and ambitious, body of work. The artist visited various sanctuaries, zoos, and rescue establishments across the United States, erecting a mobile studio wherever possible and working with a number of pre-eminent animal trainers. The animals are not mere props in photographs of people; on the contrary, McGinley considers them the subjects of these images. There exists both tension and tenderness between the models and wild animals, as they claw, clutch, nibble, and hug one another.</p>

<p>This body of work has two starkly contrasting sides, epitomized by two of the photographs on view. In the comical Dakota (Marmoset), a tiny monkey hangs from a male model's pubic hair, partly obscuring his genitals. The human legs and torso are covered in scratches and the marmoset stares directly at the camera, wearing an expression of apparent shock. In Parakeets, a flock of lushly colored birds tears across a blue background while a girl, face obscured by a blurred green and white wing, stretches out her arms in an imitation of flight. The barroom roughhouse of the former and dulcet elegance of the latter act as the exhibition's counterweights. Where the first piece is grotesque and lascivious, as humorous as it is horrifying, the other - a gushing moment of poetic beauty - strikes a profound emotional and visual harmony.</p>

<p>NADINE ROVNER - SOMEWHERE NOT HERE</p>

<p>In Somewhere Not Here, Nadine Rovner’s scenes of longing, anticipation and hope are formed rather than found by the artist.  Rovner works in the tradition of the staged photograph, beginning with a feeling or idea, and creating a scene to portray it. While often associated with contemporary artists, this approach to photography goes back to complex dramas that were made for the camera in the 19th century.</p>

<p>Staged photography is also the foundation for most photographic commercial work, and it has long been a bridge between photography and cinema. Rovner draws from all these precedents, yet her images stand out for their subtlety and understatement.  Rather than the harsh irony or hyperrealism that often characterize staged photography, Rovner’s images dwell in a hazy border between reality and memory, hinting at a hidden story, but revealing only fragments.  These spare dramas have little overt action, but they contain a palpable sense of tension, like the opening moments in a film, when many things are possible, or the closing sequence where much remains undetermined.</p>

<p>JOHN CHIARA - CREATMONT AT CORAL</p>

<p>The exhibited works were primarily shot in San Francisco’s
Potrero Hill, Excelsior, Diamond Heights and Mission districts using
his 34 x 28 inch camera, which he tows around the city on a
trailer. Chiara captures quiet vignettes of urban life – juxtaposing
views of streets and buildings with more scenic vistas that only
subtly nod to their city surroundings. As if physical manifestations
of one’s memory of the landscape, the pictures are evocative,
meditative and brooding.</p>

<p>Chiara’s singular approach combines shooting and darkroom
processing, printing directly onto positive color photographic
paper known as Ilfochrome; as such, they are unique works that
cannot be reproduced. He affixes the paper to the camera using
tape, vestiges of which often mark the picture’s surface to varying
effect. Chiara controls the exposure time instinctively, using his
hand to dodge and burn the image. Due to their large scale, the
prints are developed in capped PVC pipes, a process in which
the chemicals are blindly agitated across the paper, leaving
behind their ethereal, almost painterly traces on the images.
The resulting pictures reflect a sophisticated balance between
Chiara’s dexterity with his tools and the serendipity intrinsic to
his treatment of materials and process.</p>

<p>HERB RITTS - L.A. STYLE</p>

<p>He revolutionized fashion photography, modernized the nude, and transformed celebrities into icons.
Through hard work and a distinctive vision, Herb Ritts (1952–2002) fashioned himself into one of the top photographers to emerge from the 1980s. Ritts's aesthetic incorporated facets of life in and around Los Angeles. He often made use of the bright California sunlight to produce bold contrasts, and his preference for outdoor locations such as the desert and the beach helped to separate his work from that of his New York-based peers. Ritts's intimate portraiture, his modern yet classical treatment of the nude, and his innovative approach to fashion brought him international acclaim and placed him securely within an American tradition of portrait and magazine photography that includes Richard Avedon, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Irving Penn.</p>

<p>From the late 1970s until Ritts's untimely death from AIDS-related complications in 2002, his ability to create images that successfully bridged the gap between art and commerce was not only a testament to the power of his imagination and technical skill but also marked the synergistic union between art, popular culture, and business that followed in the wake of the Pop Art movement of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

<p>This display focuses on ten key works from this period which are exhibited for the first time, and includes photographs of actors Fenella Fielding, Ian Holm, Anna Massey, Sarah Miles with her brother Christopher, Corin Redgrave, Peter Wyngarde, Mike Sarne; playwright Harold Pinter with the cast of The Caretaker, singer Dusty Springfield, and entrepreneur Richard Branson. Peter Rand continues to specialize in portraiture and fashion photography.</p>

<p>Born in Dorset, Rand attended Ealing Art and Photographic College, before working as an assistant to Peter Peck at Woburn Studios (1958-9). In 1960, he joined the John French Studios, and in 1962 two of his photographs appeared on the cover of the September and December issues of British Vogue. An editorial contract with Vogue followed, and Rand remained with the magazine until 1970, photographing the leading figures of the 1960s.</p>

<p>WILLIE DOHERTY - PHOTO/TEXT/85/92</p>

<p>Doherty’s ongoing concerns with the complexities and contradictions of contested terrain were firmly established early on. These works probed the tensions and anxieties of what was visible and invisible, of what could be said and what could not. The works in the exhibition reveal something of the social and political conditions of the period that saw the entrance of the Irish Republican movement into the political process and negotiations with the British government over the North of Ireland. They also bear traces of the artistic possibilities and debates at the time of production, which sought to politicise conceptual art practice.</p>

<p>The specific content of these works – of boundary building and the pervasive nature of surveillance, the apparent incommensurability of polarized political factions and the scars these divisions leave on the landscape – remain relevant today.</p>

<p>CHRISTER STROMHOLM</p>

<p>From Strömholm’s eminent body of work Les Amies de la Place Blanche, these famous portraits of transvestites depict individuals living on the periphery of society, enduring ‘the roughness of the streets,’ however there is a delicacy and poignancy that emanates from Strömholm’s portraits in contrast to their gritty setting.  In his book of the same title, Strömholm describes this intimate collection of pictures as memoires of his daily life, taken whilst living in Pigalle, as he immersed himself in the lifestyle of these ‘night birds’.</p>

<p>Christer Strömholm (1918-2002), born in Stockholm, is a prominent figure in the history of Swedish photography.  His pictures from the early fifties consist of sharply focused black and white compositions of walls, shadows and clear-cut interiors. While periodically living in Paris during the 1950s and 1960s he developed a style more in tune with street-photography and it was at this time that he made his famous portraits of transvestites and transsexuals at the Place Blanche.  This particular oeuvre of work was massively progressive, documenting a marginalised group of society who did not fit into the social strata of Paris at the time.</p>

<p>NOEL BOWLER - MAKING SPACE</p>

<p>Bowler reveals the quiet transformation of everyday spaces in urban, residential and rural locations. He records how private homes, warehouses, office spaces, and industrial units are being turned into spaces for prayer. Whilst Catholicism is the majority religion in Ireland, Bowler’s images challenge this monocultural view, providing evidence of a strong and proud Muslim community. Making Space provides a unique record of a major, though not widely acknowledged, change in Irish society.</p>

<p>Devoid of people, Bowler’s photographs draw attention to the material details that reveal the connections, overlaps, and divergences between Western and Islamic cultures. In one image, copies of the Quran are stacked on bookshelves, incongruously accompanied by Quality Street and Roses tins; whilst in another image a prayer space is decorated with Christmas garlands.</p>

<p>For over 25 years Simon Annand has been given unprecedented access to the secret backstage world of London’s West End, shooting everything from Chekhov to Panto.<br>
The Half or ‘final call’ is the half an hour before the curtain rises, when an actor is left in solitude to focus on the
performance ahead of them. This world of preparation is intimate, yet Simon Annand has witnessed these intriguing
moments that the audience never sees. Portraying each actor as a worker, his subtle, engaging and intimate portraits allow the viewer to see the physical and mental preparation that is required as the actor leaves their day behind, in readiness for performing on the stage that evening.</p>

<p>In February 1962, The Sunday Times launched the Magazine - the UK’s first colour newspaper supplement. “My God, this is going to be a disaster,” groaned Roy Thomson, the then owner of The Sunday Times.

<p>THOMAS RUFF - MA.R.S.</p>

<p>Astronomy has fascinated Ruff since childhood. In 1989 he presented Sterne, his first images of the night sky based on archival photographs that he acquired from the European Southern Observatory in Chile that were taken with a specially designed telescopic lens. From these photographs, he selected specific details that were then enlarged to a uniform grand scale. Almost twenty years later, he returned to contemplating the universe and its mysteries via the public Internet archive of NASA.</p>

<p>The cassini series of 2008 was based on photographic captures of Saturn with its candy-colored moons and rings. Ruff enlarged the images to the point where the image resolution meets its limit and the planet starts to crumble, pixel by pixel into the black void of the galaxy. In the new ma.r.s. series, also sourced from the NASA website, Ruff has transformed the raw black and white fragmentary representations of the planet Mars with interjections of saturated color, such as the blood-red atmospheric haze of ma.r.s. 01_III (2011) or the steel-gray striations of ma.r.s. 02_II (2011). In addition to the large C-prints, he has experimented for the first time with 3D image-making to extraordinary effect, and several are presented here that can be viewed with or without viewing glasses.</p>

<p>JERRY MCMILLAN - THE ARTIST'S IMAGE</p>

<p>This exhibition demonstrates his inventive techniques and collaborative efforts at creating a persona rather than a mere likeness. Through symbolic and whimsically staged role-playing, McMillan produced implied narratives that were often intended for exhibition announcements and magazine advertisements.  For example, when he was told that Judy Gerowitz was changing her name to Chicago and needed an image to announce her new name and upcoming exhibition, he put her in a boxing ring.</p>

<p>The tough, confrontational photo of Chicago, wearing boxing gloves with her name emblazoned across her chest, suggested a challenge to the male-dominated art scene in L.A. In fact, during the 60s, artists in L.A would one-up each other with ego-driven exhibition announcements picturing themselves in underwear, surfing, or performing other antics.  In this vein, McMillan created a folding exhibition poster/invite for his friend Joe Goode that pictured the artist, but did not include Goode’s name, implying, that his name was not even necessary. The exhibition at Craig Krull Gallery will include McMillan’s vintage photos, contact sheets and examples of his work in exhibition announcements, catalogue design, magazine ads, and even personalized artist stationery. Jerry McMillan’s contributions in these areas were vital to the developing LA art scene, not simply in the presentation of L.A. artists, but in his shaping of how they were perceived.</p>

In his images of the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Mount Shasta, Mount St. Helens and Salt Lake City (Park City), we see stark, uninterrupted terrains where meaning is made through what it is absent, as much as what is seen. What at first appears to be a pure white snow-capped mountain is in fact a digitally rendered laser scan of the earth interpreted from United States Geological Survey data, a ‘terrain model' used to measure climate and land change - to measure man's effect on the earth.</p>

<p>Belying his empirical methodology is the fact that each of these terrains has a rich and conflicting cultural legacy. Beginning with the idealised aesthetic of the Romantic sublime via the deadpan industrial frames of the New Topographics photographers a century later, each has been subject to the gaze of artistic, political, and sociological categories claiming this territory as their own. Extending ideas of the frontier and seeing anew, Transmission captures the world as if from space, functioning not only as a map of the land but as a mapping of the discourses that these lands have come to represent.</p>

<p>MITCH EPSTEIN</p>

<p>Mitch Epstein’s new work features the idiosyncratic trees that populate New York City, underscoring the importance of trees in urban life and their complex relationship with the city’s human dwellers.<br>
Trees have long been a leitmotiv in Epstein’s projects, especially in his series American Power (2003-2008). After five years of photographing the manifestations of energy production and consumption across the United States, Epstein decided to make pictures that reflect how he, “would like to see the world, not simply how I have inherited it.”</p>

<p>Epstein began this yearlong project in search of designated Great Trees, as deemed by the Parks Department in 1985. Finding these trees was less important to Epstein than the pursuit of them, which led him to discover and photograph numerous unofficial “great” trees with remarkable qualities of their own.
From Parsons Boulevard, Flushing to Sprague Avenue, Staten Island to Prospect Park, Brooklyn, Epstein returned to photograph the same trees through changing light and seasons. The resulting photographs invert people’s usual view of their city: trees no longer function as background or landscape, but, instead, become the focus of the image, dominating the human life and architecture around them.</p>

<p>ODED HIRSCH - NOTHING NEW</p>

<p>Hirsch’s unaffected documentary-style and linear narrative structures are sometimes at odds with the questionable nature of the actions performed on film. In “50 Blue,” Hirsch’s brother pushes his father in a wheelchair through a rugged terrain towards a destination the audience only comes to know at the end - a destination that seems anti-climactic at best. After having been hoisted up onto a high structure along the water’s edge, the paraplegic father is left to appreciate a view (obstructed by a horizontal bar) of the shoreline.</p>

<p>In this sense, Hirsch toys with the very idea of accomplishment, interrogating the assumption that whatever was suffered through, despite the effort, was worth it. While something has indeed been achieved, and a certain amount of exertion has resulted from the completion of a particular task (in this case laboring to bring a man in a wheelchair to the top of a lake-side tower), its significance seems unsure.</p>

<p>TROY BRAUNTUCH</p>

<p>Troy Brauntuch cuts up or crops the pictures he has sourced elsewhere. Eerily vague remains of an event are seen against a dark background, his preferred method being to transfer the cropped images to black cotton fabric using white Conté crayons. The works often look like a combination of painting and photography and at first sight one might assume they are dark-toned monochrome pictures. Gradually, on closer study, one can distinguish specific motifs as they emerge out of a spectrum of grays in the almost velvety black picture ground: a woman wearing niqab, her face seen underneath a transparent map of Florida; a window display of variously arranged gloves; soldiers in close combat; or an elegant, black-and-white dotted coat.</p>

<p>Except for works that reference violence or stills from thrillers, most of Brauntuch’s pictures - especially the photographs - are unspectacular and slow to reveal their surprisingly mysterious and at times understated subject matter. Having chosen to devote himself to the visual arts, the artist simultaneously draws attention to what a picture does not contain, thereby destabilizing the relationship between pictures and their alleged meaning. He accentuates that relationship by switching back and forth between personal photographs and found images that have been made public.</p>

<p>W. EUGENE SMITH - THE JAZZ LOFT PROJECT</p>

<p>In 1957, W. Eugene Smith, a former photographer at Life magazine, moved out of the home he shared with his wife and four children in Croton-on-Hudson, New York and moved into a dilapidated, five-story loft building at 821 Sixth Avenue in New York City’s wholesale flower district. 821 Sixth Avenue was a late-night haunt of musicians, including some of the biggest names in jazz—Charles Mingus, Zoot Sims, Bill Evans, and Thelonious Monk among them—and countless fascinating, underground characters.<br>
Between 1957 and 1965 W. Eugene Smith made approximately 40,000 exposures both inside the loft building at 821 Sixth Avenue, of the nocturnal jazz scene, and of the street below as seen through his fourth-floor window. He also wired the building like a surreptitious recording studio and made 1,740 reels (4,000 hours) of stereo and mono audiotapes, capturing more than three hundred musicians.</p>

<p>THOMAS RUFF - NUDES</p>

<p>In 2003 Ruff produced the first nudes, culling images from Internet pornography, then digitally processing them, enlarging them as far as possible, so as to cloud the crude clarity of the original images. For this exhibition, Ruff has created a series of unique monumental works, enlarged to an imposing scale while, conversely, the rawness and carnality of the original images is blurred to an innuendo. Images such as nudes dr02 (2011) become painterly illustrations of vague desire in which anonymous women sport and pose, their erotic power modified by a muted palette and hazed resolution, while in nudes ar09 (2011) the fetishistic power of the female subject is all but reduced to lush formal qualities - a cascade of thick blonde hair, the curve of pink thighs, the glossy black of a stiletto heel.</p>

<p>EVE ARNOLD - ALL ABOUT EVE</p>

<p>Conceived as a retrospective, the exhibition highlights the true diversity of Arnold’s oeuvre. Photographs of actress Marilyn Monroe, many from the set of ‘The Misfits’ (her final film before her death), will sit beside portraits of other Hollywood and West End legends such as Marlene Dietrich, Somerset Maugham, Arthur Miller, Joan Crawford, Peter O’Toole, Isabella Rossellini and Orson Welles. <br>
Arnold captured many political figures throughout her career for a number of high-profile editorial clients such as The Sunday Times Magazine and during her lifetime as a Magnum photographer, with a number of colour shots of the Queen and former prime ministers such as Margaret Thatcher, Edward Heath and John Major. This section includes other documentary photographs depicting political events such as Britain at the time of the 1981 riots and extensive coverage of Malcolm X’s Black Muslim movement in the 1960s.</p>

<p>MAX SNOW - 100 HEADLESS WOMEN</p>

<p>The walls are covered in rows of nude female torsos with obscured faces: a salon of ghostly mug shots. Church statues of saints have been soaked in diluted muriatic acid to dissolve their features. Snow has then carved and chipped away at them to achieve a more featureless, ghostlike form. In this context the faceless portraits almost become a shrine to the unknown masses of a civilization lost or a fable that was never told.</p>

<p>“When you look at a portrait you look at the eyes and the face,” says Snow. “Everyone says that the face and the eyes tell the story and that grief scars your eyes. So I like in this series to rob the viewer of that intimacy and to make it more mysterious and surreal.”</p>

<p>The faces without eyes, in their multitude, become even more haunting. One also recalls the fact that the blind are more advanced in their other senses and that, when blindfolded, one is more sensitive to touch. This idea folds in seamlessly with Max Snow’s body of work which itself exudes an innate sensuality, a dark eroticism and animal instinct in defiance of rational intellect. Snow’s photograph of himself embracing a statue comes to mind. Snow says of this portrait, “it’s strange because it looks more like I’m clinging to it and I’m not sure if it’s embracing me back.” Sometimes we need to dive into fantasy or the corporeal realm to escape the pain of the emotional or the dullness of the mundane. But as Snow points out, even these realms do not always offer us comfort.</p>

<p>CONVERSATIONS</p>

<p>Conversations: Photography from the Bank of America Collection comprises more than 100 photographs drawn from the renowned Bank of America Collection. The exhibition documents the evolution of photography since the 1850s and presents some of the most notable photographers of the 19th and 20th-centuries. Hand-picked from thousands of photographs, the works are displayed so as to create “conversations” between images by individual artists and across a wide range of themes, including portraits, landscapes, street photography and abstraction.</p>

<p>The exhibition presents works by some of photography’s most celebrated names, from 19th-century innovators Gustave Le Gray, Julia Margaret Cameron and Carleton Watkins, via 20th-century luminaries: Alfred Stieglitz, Harry Callahan, and Irving Penn, to contemporary image makers: William Eggleston, Thomas Ruff and Cindy Sherman. Modern works are juxtaposed with older works, European with American, and staged subjects with documentary images. These conversations create unique visual groupings, including images of visitors responding to art in museums, such as Thomas Struth’s Audience 4 (2004), which shows people gazing upward at Michelangelo’s statue of David at the Academia Gallery in Florence, and Musée du Louvre 4, Paris (1989), where visitors contemplate Théodore Géricault’s famous Raft of the Medusa in a Louvre gallery.</p>

<p>DASH SNOW</p>

<p>Snow archived roughly 8,000 of his Polaroids but showed small groupings of the originals only three times during his life (most people are familiar with them by way of 147 scanned and enlarged C-print editions). Proving to be his entrée to the art world, it was fabled that Snow used the Polaroids to document experiences he might not otherwise remember due to intoxication. This sensationalism justly grabs hold of Snow’s most lurid subject matter as well as his nostalgic bent. It also fails to acknowledge the strange and reflexive intimacy Snow imparted by both presiding over and participating in the photographs.</p>

<p>The groupings on view here (totalling over 400 original Polaroids) show the breadth of experience the artist compulsively chose to document. From the banal to the extreme, from the melancholy to the ecstatic, each photograph would seem to buttress a facet of the artist’s uncommon experience. That he began shooting these pictures roughly at the time of 9-11 (when Snow was 20 years old) is not immaterial. Images of Snow and his friends writing graffiti, flashing guns, making out and making art all give us a larger picture of the wiliness and abandon that would propel his circle after the attacks.</p>

<p>CHEN MAN</p>

<p>Chen Man is one of the most well known female Chinese photographers of the 21st century and leading fashion photographer in China.<br>
Her images play with the juxtaposition of old and new, real and imaginary, ordinary and ideal. She frequently uses modern city landscapes and historical buildings in China as the backdrop for her images and mixes it with street culture, animation, sci-fi and pop references.</p>

<p>Chen Man's images are often heavily manipulated and involve painstaking and complex layers of post-production. The hyper-real aesthetic of her images alludes to a desire for unobtainable perfection.</p>

<p>Chen Man's rise coincides with emergence of a consumer culture in China and the desire for luxury consumer goods. The power and poignancy of her work lies in her ability to understand people's desires and to visualise them through her striking images. A role model for the post-80s generation, her images capture the personalities and attitudes of a new generation of Chinese.</p>

<p>SIGMA DP1 AND DP2 MERRILL CAMERAS</p>

<p>The Sigma DP1 Merrill and DP2 Merrill each boast exclusively-designed, high-performance telecentric fixed lenses.<BR> The DP1 Merrill features a wide, 19mm F2.8 lens, which is the equivalent to a 28mm lens on a 35mm SLR camera. The DP2 Merrill, however, offers a 30mm F2.8 lens, which is the equivalent to a 45mm lens on a 35mm camera. Both cameras are compact and lightweight, and feature Sigma’s own “F” Low Dispersion (FLD) glass, which performs like fluorite glass and significantly improves lens performance, as well as Super Multi Layer Coating to reduce flare and ghosting. <BR>
With the 46-megapixel, full-color Foveon X3 Direct Image Sensor, the new DP cameras capture all primary RGB colors at each pixel location with three layers, which results in incredibly detailed images with a three-dimensional feel.”</p>

<p>EDWARD BURTYNSKY - OIL</p>

<p>Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky has travelled the world to chronicle the effect of oil on all our lives, and to reveal the rarely seen mechanics of its production and distribution.</p>

<p>This exhibition shows three sections from Burtynsky’s series OIL: Extraction and Refinement, Transportation and Motor Culture and The End of Oil. The works depict landscapes scarred by the extraction of oil, and the cities and suburban sprawl defined by its use. He also eloquently addresses the coming end of oil, as we face its rising cost and dwindling availability.</p>

<p>Burtynsky's colour photographs render his subjects with a transfixing clarity of detail. From aerial views of oil fields and highways ribboning across the landscape, to derelict oil derricks and mammoth oil-tanker shipbreaking operations, we are confronted with the evidence of our dependence on this finite resource.</p>

<p>ANJA NIEMI: DO NOT DISTURB</p>

<p>Hotel rooms are impersonal and neutral by their very nature, designed to house visitors, not permanent residents.
Any one person may not alter their interiors according to subjective taste; invisible staff will always put the room
back in its original form when a guest leaves. A hotel room is always a paradox as it says to its guests: Do feel at
home, but please don’t. For a limited time, however, one can lock the door, pretend to own the space and feel at
home, albeit in a strange, indifferent place.
“I merge myself into the interior of rooms,” Niemi has said in regard to some of her earlier works.</p>

<p>In Do Not Disturb, her latest series of photographs, the artist’s relationships with interiors continues to evolve, this time in
hotel rooms. To make these photographs, Niemi fled her safe and predictable existence as a Norwegian woman,
mother of two, committed life partner and responsible citizen in one of the world’s safest countries, with a
suitcase filled only with borrowed garments and her camera. At undisclosed locations she checked herself into
carefully selected hotels and rooms, which through their very neutrality and lack of expectation could offer Niemi
a refuge from the repetitiveness that is mundane life.</p>

<p>MARK POWER - THE SOUND OF TWO SONGS</p>

<p>Made over a period of five years, The Sound of Two Songs offers an extensive and personal photographic survey of Poland.<BR>
When Power spent a month in Poland as part of a project instigated by Magnum Photos to document countries joining the European Union that year. Despite having no familial ties to the country, he soon became fascinated by Poland. Over the next five years he made a further twenty visits, often accompanied by Polish photographer Konrad Pustoła who generously shared his knowledge of his native land. Over time Power’s focus shifted from an investigation into the effects of EU membership into a more subjective, poetic and autobiographical response to a country he grew to love.</p>

<p>Alongside a series of portraits of people he met on his travels, the majority of Power’s large format, meticulously detailed colour photographs depict landscapes often featuring surprising or metaphorical elements.</p>

<p>BERTIEN VAN MANEN - LET'S SIT DOWN BEFORE WE GO</p>

<p>Van Manen’s work is a meditation on human existence, revealing
the truth of particular lives. Selected from her
travels through Uzbekistan, Siberia, Ukraine,
Georgia, Moldova, Moscow and Tartarstan since 1990, van Manen’s photographs are characterized by the intimacy she achieves
with her subjects, with whom she spent countless hours sitting at their tables, lodging in their homes, immersed in their reality.</p>

<p>Van Manen provides a window into Russian lives following years of struggle under the Communist regime. As critic Ryszard Kapuściński notes in his introduction to van
Manen’s 1995 book, A hundred summers, a hundred winters, the artist’s lens penetrates
the “most inaccessible of places—the homes of ordinary people—in order to show us
how millions of Russians live and sleep, what they eat, what they look like in their everyday life, in their flats, at their tables, in their beds.” In the case of the former Soviet
empire, people were conditioned to be fearful and suspicious, long forbidden to exhibit whom they really were to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>GUSMANO CESARETTI</p>

<p>The main gallery will feature work from the early period of Cesaretti’s career (1970s) in which he immersed himself in the East Los Angeles culture. His photographs of this era celebrated a sub-culture that had rarely been captured before. The exhibition will include twenty-four vintage, unique prints that have recently been discovered and will be shown for the first time in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>An Italian immigrant who moved to Los Angeles in the 1970s, Cesaretti quickly became fascinated by East Los Angeles. Inspired by the colors, people and graffiti that populated the East Side, he began to capture the vulnerability and uncensored quality of this area. Always honest when shooting his subjects, Cesaretti presents them as they are: violent, loving, confident, scared, full of life. It is this energy and conflict inherent in those who occupy the edges of society that drives his photographic investigations.</p>

<p>In the Project Space at Roberts &amp; Tilton, Cesaretti visits a turbulent section of Colón, Panama. Approached with the same spirit and tenacity reflected in his previous works, these recent intimate photographs of children in an impoverished community offer a fresh perspective into this part of the world. Cesaretti, an outsider himself, became personally connected with the subjects he was shooting. The intimacy existing in the photographs is a result of the relationships that Cesaretti built with his subjects over time. Never forcing a situation, Cesaretti addresses his subjects with great concern and patience, allowing for an essential level of trust to be established. The resulting openness between Cesaretti and his subjects permeates the work, allowing the viewer access to a world that would otherwise be guarded against outsiders.</p>

<p>RYAN MCGINLEY - YOU &amp; I</p>

<p>Ryan McGinleys first retrospective monograph. For this beautifully realized volume the artist has selected the best photographs from his first decade of work.<br>
McGinley’s newest work signals a departure from the urban youth culture images for which he is best known; he has been working in natural settings outside New York City, creating specific situations for his subjects to lose themselves in the moment. McGinley embraces nature as a site of freedom and captures a sense of buoyancy and release.</p>

<p>Ryan McGinley makes large-scale color photographs of his friends, a group that forms part of New York’s Lower East Side youth culture. He uses photography to break down barriers between public and private spheres of activity. His subjects are willing collaborators: drawn from skateboard, music, and graffiti subcultures, they perform for the camera and expose themselves with a frank self-awareness that is distinctly contemporary. The results form a portrait of a generation that is savvy about visual culture and acutely aware of how identity can be communicated through photography</p>

<p>JITKA HANZLOVA - HERE</p>

<p>The residual sense of foreignness to the landscape, language and people is at the heart of the series. As Hanzlová explains, “Otherness is a challenge. It keeps you alert and sharpens your senses.” The images reflect this visual acuity, presenting curious landscapes clearly shaped by human intervention yet resplendent in their poetic sensibility. “The feel of a place is very important to my work, especially the light,” says the artist. Hanzlová’s expert treatment of light and attention to detail lend a sense of the transformative in these landscapes, as seen through the eyes of a poet.</p>

<p>Hanzlová has produced several other bodies of work since beginning HERE in 1998, including: Cotton Rose, a series of portraits in Japan, published as a monograph by Steidl; Leonardo, a series of Renaissance inspired portraits; Female, a portrait series of women the artist encountered on the streets of Europe and America; and Forest , a quiet yet powerful exploration of the forest near the Czech village where she grew up. Void of any trace of civilization, the Forest images possess an out-of-time, enchanted quality.</p>

<p>LAURA BUCKLEY - FATA MORGANA</p>

<p>The title Fata Morgana refers to a highly complex superior mirage where inverted and erect images are stacked one on top of another causing an object on the horizon to be distorted beyond recognition. The name also refers to Morgan le Fay, mythical figure from the Arthurian legends at once a villain, seductress, witch, healer or goddess, her unquestionable power is dictated by her ability to shape-shift throughout the myths and legends in which she appears.</p>

<p>This personification of a natural phenomenon and anthropomorphic sensibility in humanity gently riffs through Buckley’s work. For the past four years the artist has been producing multifaceted installations incorporating components ranging from motorised plywood structures, Perspex sculptures, sound and projected moving image. Her idiosyncratic use of light both within her installations and films is exacerbated by the sleek surfaces she includes which reflect projections onto the viewer, or are the focus and subject matter of the films themselves.</p>

<p>Where previously mechanical movement of objects has made up an important part of her installations, in Fata Morgana both the film and the sculpture are static. This allows the fast paced edit of the film and surface of the sculpture to interact with the body and perception of the entering viewer, including and absorbing them into the kaleidoscopic installation.</p>

<p>JAVIER TÉLLEZ - ROTATIONS</p>

<p>Rotations (Prometheus and Zwitter) (2011), a new film installation produced after a year-long DAAD residency in Berlin, focuses on the history of the psychiatric institution and its relation to historical events of the 20th century in the German context. The main protagonists of Téllez ' new films are two sculptures. One is Prometheus (1937) by Arno Breker, a monumental male figure that represents the mythological hero grasping a torch.</p>

<p>The other figure is Weib und Mann oder Adam und Eva, also known as “Zwitter” (1920) by Karl Genzel, a small wooden figure depicting an hermaphrodite that holds a clock in its hand. Rotations (Prometheus and Zwitter) is an installation composed of two 35 mm silent films projections, showing these sculptures rotating at the same speed in different directions. The sculptures' endless rotation is echoed in the installation by the film passing through the projectors in a loop, referring to the cinematic apparatus and its obsolescence as to the theme of repetition and difference in history. The films show the morphological similarities of the sculptures focusing in extreme details that display their materiality, but it is through the very disparity between the figures that meaning is articulated.</p>

<p>ALEX WEBB - THE SUFFERING OF LIGHT</p>

<p>Recognized as a pioneer of American color photography, since the 1970s, Webb has consistently created photographs characterized by intense color and light. His work, with its richly layered and complex composition, touches on multiple genres, including street photography, photojournalism, and fine art, but as Webb notes, “To me, it all is photography. You have to go out and explore the world with a camera.”</p>

<p>Webb’s ability to distill gesture, color, and contrasting cultural tensions into single, beguiling frames results in evocative images that convey a sense of enigma, irony, and humor.

<p>Bringing together more than 180 photographs, this retrospective survey traces the artist’s career from the mid 1970s to the present.<br>Highlighted in the exhibition are in-depth presentations of her key series, including the groundbreaking series "Untitled Film Stills" (1977–80), the black-and-white pictures that feature the artist in stereotypical female roles inspired by 1950s and 1960s Hollywood, film noir, and European art-house films; her ornate history portraits (1989–90), in which the artist poses as aristocrats, clergymen, and milkmaids in the manner of old master paintings; and her larger-than-life society portraits (2008) that address the experience and representation of aging in the context of contemporary obsessions with youth and status.</p>

<p>The exhibition will explore dominant themes throughout Sherman’s career, including artifice and fiction; cinema and performance; horror and the grotesque; myth, carnival, and fairy tale; and gender and class identity. Also included are Sherman’s recent photographic murals (2010), which will have their American premiere at MoMA.</p>

<p>DAYANITA SINGH - HOUSE OF LOVE</p>

<p>Dayanita Singh’s latest body of work, entitled “House of Love”, is novelistic in its approach yet curiously elliptical in its multiple subject matters. For the first time in a single series, Ms. Singh has combined black-and-white with color photographs, images shot both in India and around the world, yet none are identified and all are allowed to be free-floating, tethered to one another only by the circumstances of “stories” in which they have been grouped (with individual titles such as “Continuous cities, “ “Theft in a cake shop,” “Departure lounge,” and “Being of darkness,” the nine “stories” ranging in groups as small as six and as large as seventeen pictures). Everything and all to be at the service of the book of the same name, Ms. Singh’s primary medium for her images and the unifying structure in which this diversity becomes succinct.</p>

<p>The subjects of Ms. Singh’s pictures range from bucolic landscapes and congested cityscapes; portraits of friends, acquaintances and strangers (both formally posed and spontaneously captured); arrangements of objects found in homes, museums and offices; the interiors of all types of spaces and the exteriors of all manner of constructions. This multiplicity finds cohesion in proscribed themes which run throughout Ms. Singh’s project: the romance of travel, the mysteries of attraction, and the displaced yearnings of desire. “House of Love” is Ms. Singh’s response to the delirious satisfaction she has found within the works of her favourite authors (Italo Calvino, Amitav Ghosh, Orhan Pamuk, W.G. Sebald, Vikram Seth, among others), telling a story of life and how it is lived in the way she knows how to, through photographs collected into a book.</p>

<p>THE WEDDING (THE WALKER EVANS POLAROID PROJECT)</p>

<p>The Wedding (The Walker Evans Polaroid Project) ultimately came to include: 83 Walker Evans Polaroids; elements from Bird, a body of work by Roni Horn made between 1998 and 2007; a collotype from Eadweard Muybridge's 1887 Animal Locomotion series; a photograph of c1900 Paris by Eugène Atget; a 19th-century French model of a cooper's shop, with tools to scale; a large, 19th-century English birdhouse; and a selection of early 20th-century American Arts and Craft Movement furniture, including original and custom-replications, designed by Gustav Stickley.</p>

<p>A list of components, however, like a roster of artists, indicates little about the content of any of my shows. My exhibitions are meant to be poetic rather than didactic, amalgamating diverse individual works and objects into a coherent whole. A curatorial composition has its own unity and point of view, like an individual work in any artistic medium. Individual artworks and objects stand in specific relationships to each other, both in terms of their physical placement and their cognitive consonance, dissonance and resonance. Their form and the medium in which each is made, as well as the places in which they are set, provide opportunities for viewers to mine them individually and together for meaning, knowledge and insight.</p>

<p>SHARON HARPER</p>

<p>“One Month, Weather Permitting” is a series of photographic images of the night sky over Banff, Alberta in Canada.  Utilizing multiple extended-exposure photographic techniques over several consecutive nights, Harper records the movement of the stars and allows the randomness of the marks made by the light trails they leave on film to highlight “chance” as an important aspect of the photographic process itself. What results is imagery that is “technological seeing”, so to speak; views of the night sky visible to the human eye only with the aid of the camera and the film media.</p>

<p>“Twelve Hours From Winter To Spring” is a series of landscape images` taken during a flight from Fairbanks, Alaska to Boston, Massachusetts over a period of twelve hours.  Although the images record the change of landscape, light and scenery as shifts of location, one can also perceive the shift to be seasonal, from winter to spring; a trick of perception that separates what we see from how we interpret such information in our minds. Further, the imagery is presented in grid-form as a singular large-scale photograph, pushing discourse that could range from documentary to narrative, when in reality, it is wholly neither, as the aesthetic choices of the artist play an equal part in the final presentation of the images.</p>

<p>“Sun/Moon” is Harper’s latest body of work and also draws attention to the act of seeing as a two-part process; on one part, a physical act of reacting to visual stimulus and on another, a cognitive act of recognition and interpretation. By connecting a digital camera to a telescope and capturing multiple images within seconds, she mimics this act of looking and understanding on a subject that we would not be able to see directly (the sun and the surface of the moon) without the aid of the mediating instruments she has employed.  Although distortions and reflections also result from this process, the sequential presentation of the images of the sun and the moon trace the experience of looking and analysis; a metaphor to “seeing” as a cumulative act and yet an elusive one, as it is imperfect and subject to chance.</p>

<p>LAURA HORELLI - THE TERRACE</p>

<p>In The Terrace, Laura Horelli addresses her childhood experiences in Nairobi, where she lived for four years with her family in a modernist compound in the later 1970s and early 1980s. The work includes video recordings of the compound and its buildings, filmed by the artist during visits to Nairobi in 2010, and also photographs of varying sizes and quality that were taken by her mother and document the everyday life of the family in Nairobi. These various perspectives are accompanied by the artist’s thoughts and ideas in a voice-over. Horelli reflects on the social and physical environment of the gated area and particularly on the relationships between the tenants and the employed staff there.</p>

<p>Horelli continues her conceptual approach, based on addressing reality in a subjective way. Personal stories are used to examine structures in society. The borders between the public and the private become diffuse.</p>

<p>PAOLO ROVERSI - NUDI</p>

<p>For more than 25 years, the nude series by Paolo Roversi called Nudi is one of the most inspiring and aesthetic nude series in contemporary photography. A plain composition and a gentle use of light make the presented women appear like gracile painted nude studies. So, the viewer’s attention is directed to the shape and the pettiness of the female body. Next to photographs of Kate Moss, Tatjana Patitz and Guinevere van Seenus, the exhibition also includes nudes of models like Laetitia Casta, as well as lately produced male Nudi photographs for the first time.</p>

<p>Paolo Roversi was born in Italy in 1947 but has been living and working in Paris for more than 37 years. His photographs have been published in several monographs and also in plenty magazines like Harper’s Bazaar, Interview, Marie Claire, Vogue and the New York Times. The photographic work of Paolo Roversi is affected by the continuous aura of grace and fragility, but also of mystery and aloofness – a result of Roversi’s virtuosic handling of 'painting with light."</p>

<p>The works continue to investigate and experiment with the phenomenon of “seeing” within the framework and with the aid of the photographic medium. She continues to point her lens towards the sky and outwards towards the landscape, presenting the potentials of the photographic medium from both scientific and aesthetic points of view; on one hand, a tool to document and record visual evidence, and on the other, a palette that taps into the sublime to create imagery that evokes dreamlike fantasy.</p>

<p>JOHANNA DIEHL - BORGO</p>

<p>In her photographs the artist deals with the structure of ideal settlements built under Benito Mussolini in the backcountry of Sicily between 1926 and 1943 which articulate an attempt of creating social order. As already in her previous series 'Displace' Johanna Diehl focuses on the memory of places, the media awareness of architecture and its connection to ideology.</p>

<p>Those programmatically designed villages, so-called "Borghi", were intended to colonize and develop the rural Sicily and served as centres for the agrarian communities. The borghi generally consist of buildings with similar types: a central piazza, a church, governmental headquarters, school and other facilities representing the structure and the claim for power of the Fascist Party. Nowadays most of the borghi may be found abandoned within a landscape as unfulfilled Utopias, as places without memory filled with time.</p>

<p>By choosing the singular 'Borgo' as title for the show Johanna Diehl emphasizes that the focal point of this cycle lies not in the enumeration of particular phenomena but in the concept of those places.</p>

<p>TIM FLACH - MORE THAN HUMAN</p>

<p>The new works reflect Tim’s current preoccupation with the contemporary relationship between humans and non-human animals, focussing on how we engage with them within the contexts of history, culture, politics and science. This will all come together in the new book, More than Human, due for publication in October 2012.</p>

<p>Through Tim’s unique vision and ability to challenge the viewer, he has created a series of images which encompass not only his personal beliefs, but the concepts common in modern and historical religious and cultural symbolism, the human obsession with ‘cuteness’, cross-breeding, the blurred line between human and animal genetic modification, conservation, morphology and plasticity.</p>

<p>KEITH PATTISON -  NO REDEMPTION</p>

<p>The Strike of 1984–85 shook the foundations of British society, tearing apart traditional mining communities. In August 1984 Keith Pattison was commissioned to photograph the strike at Easington Colliery for one month. He remained there until it ended in March 1985, photographing from behind the lines a community rallying together against implacable opposition. Pattison frames a narrative sequence of images from the optimism of August through the deepening pessimism of winter, to the final vote to return to work.</p>

<p>BORIS SAVELEV - COLOUR CONSTRUCTIONS</p>

<p>Born in Chernovitz in 1947 Boris Savelev moved to Moscowin 1966, a rocket engineer through his working life, Savelev found photography later on and has committed himself to this exciting chapter in photography’s short history wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>Regarded by many now as one of Russia’s most important living photographers, Savelev is an artist at the peak of his career. Working with Factum in Madrid, Savelev has again used this extraordinary and proprietary printing process that allows him to fully realise his photographic vision. This new show is composed solely of colour works. Adam Lowe and Rafa Rachewsky at Factum Arte in Madrid, using their own custom-made flatbed multi-layer pigment printer make the images onto gesso coated aluminum panels, allowing for an extraordinary degree of control within what is a mechanical medium.  Each image is finished by hand and then waxed which leaves the surface with a rich and penetrating range of tones and hues. There is absolutely nothing else like this printing process in the world and its permanence is proven.</p>

<p>JEAN-BAPTISTE HUYNH - MONOCHROME</p>

<p>The photographs of the series Monochrome, created by Jean-Baptise Huynh in 2010/11, are characterized by the strict and uncompromising reduction to the colour black. A spare but elaborate lighting supports this feature, so that the black objects and portraits appear in their deepest shades. The dominant black impressively embraces the colour meaning of sublime elegance and mysteriousness, as well as the complaining subtlety and elusiveness, which imposingly unfold in the photographs – a delightful interaction, encouraged by the compositional clearness, so that the recipient can experience the creation and its distinctiveness of the colour black.</p>

<p>Jean-Baptise Huynh was born in France, as a son of a French mother and a Vietnamese father in 1966. So far, nine publications of his extensive photographic work of landscapes, portraits, nudes and still life have been released, all in sophisticated and high-quality design.</p>

<p>MASSIMO VITALI: NEW WORK</p>

<p>Vitali has become one of the most celebrated contemporary photographers worldwide, renowned for his large colour prints depicting the crowded beaches and shorelines of the Mediterranean Sea. However, this new series focuses on the natural – rocks, cliffs, waterfalls, caves and quarries. Holidaymakers have been reduced to mere dots, hovering uncomfortably on the shore, or taking shelter in the shadow of monumental natural landmarks. Seen from such a distance, these crowds mimic colonies of mammals – huddles of seals or penguins - washed up on the rocks. The power of nature comes to the fore – in one image people are literally replaced by crashing waves as the tide moves in. Everything is now in flux and the old certainties have been washed away. Our frailty in the face of such power is thrown into focus and we are forced to confront our mortality and our inability to resist the forces of nature.</p>

<p>Vitali started his series of large format photographs at a specific moment in Italian history: 1994, the year in which Berlusconi came to power. He has said of this moment, “I wanted to look into the faces of the people that voted for Berlusconi and see if I could understand why. My photography comes from absolute matter-of-fact situations, but also from a deep curiosity that I possess for people, for what they do and how they think.” For Vitali, the beach was a place where the mundane and everyday merges with natural beauty, and where he could confront Italians in a place of vulnerability.</p>

<p>SHARON CORE: 1606-1907</p>

<p>Exploring the subject of floral still-life painting. Similar to the artist’s earlier work, the seriesexamines the relationship of representational painting to the medium of photography. But rather than focusing on a specific artist or time period, as in the previous Thiebaud and Early American works, the new series references a pictorial convention within painting as a whole.  The artist’s sources range from the style of early Flemishpainters, such as Bosschaert and Jan Brueghel, to the Modernists Odilon Redon and Fantin-Latour.</p>

<p>The work engages time in both a sense of history and temporality. Flowers are the most temporal of objects: fragile, changeable, and short-lived, a flower’s bloom opens, bends, fades and falls according to degrees of light, temperature, water, and weather. It assumes its character from its atmosphere.  As a subject for art, however, flowers have been portrayed for centuries by artists of all stripes and have an established permanence in the lexicon of art history.</p>

<p>It is between these polarities of transience and permanence that the current work is situated. With an eye towards the flower in its natural state and as well as the styles of representation that attempt to order, organize, celebrate, and lament a fleeting symbol of beauty throughout history, Core hasthoroughly explored the nature of the painted bouquet.</p>

<p>MITCH EPSTEIN: AMERICAN POWER</p>

<p>American Power (2003-9) examines how energy is produced and used in the American landscape, questioning the power of nature, government and corporations. Epstein was awarded the prestigious Prix Pictet photographic award in March 2011 for this body of work, which offers a radical reflection on “the American Dream gone awry”.</p>

<p>The project began in 2003 when Epstein photographed a small town in Ohio after compulsory land purchase by the American Electric Power company. He went on to document 25 US States over a period of six years, producing a prolific body of work that depicts the effects of mass consumption.</p>

<p>AFTER THE THAW</p>

<p>After The Thaw presents a unique and stimulating insight into the lives of people living in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia and Tajikistan. When these countries gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the attention of the world briefly focused upon this cluster of new nations. The prospect of democracy seemed to offer a genuine opportunity for a future of peace and prosperity. Two decades on, away from the media spotlight, millions of people continue to struggle to build a livelihood in a post-communist world.</p>

<p>After The Thaw offers a stark, moving and contemporary portrayal of some of the remarkable individuals and communities that populate the region today. The exhibition reveals an astonishing richness and variety of cultures, and Oxfam is proud to be able to assist in bringing attention to these inspiring people. Oxfam runs programmes in all of the countries featured, and continues to work to help support people and fight poverty throughout the region.</p>

<p>DIANE ARBUS</p>

<p>In this first major retrospective in France, Jeu de Paume presents a selection of two hundred photographs that affords an opportunity to explore the origins, scope, and aspirations of a wholly original force in photography. It includes all of the artist’s iconic photographs as well as many that have never been publicly exhibited. Even the earliest examples of her work demonstrate Arbus’s distinctive sensibility through the expression on a face, someone’s posture, the character of the light, and the personal implications of objects in a room or landscape. These elements, animated by the singular relationship between the photographer and her subject, conspire to implicate the viewer with the force of a personal encounter.</p>

<p>JERUSALEM</p>

<p>Through the eyes of three analytical photographers, John Davies, Charles Jones and Colin Jones, this exhibition documents British life in the twentieth century. The pictures seem to capture the simplicity of a by gone era; however, in doing so they also challenge the changes taking place today,forcing us to interrogate our individual responsibilities towards the country we live in.</p>

<p>The recession of recent years has hit Britain hard; with the riots of this summer being just one example of our social cohesion wearing away. In this increasingly uncertain world, in which the individual is so often governed by forces out of the remit of his or her control we are reminded of life’s basic essentials: food on the table, a roof over our heads and a job that provides an income to support oneself or a family.</p>

<p>Once again, a new world order, a New Jerusalem, has been promised by politicians and economists. But the journey will be a long one. Globalization forces a need for shared responsibility, and yet the rate of change within both the microcosm of individual countries and the larger global community leaves little time for reflection.</p>

Many times this process involves composing pictures from the inside of a large hand-built camera, that is mounted on a flatbed trailer, and produces large scale, one of a kind, positive exposures.</p>

<p>John Chiara received a B.F.A. in Photography from the University of Utah and an M.F.A. in Photography from the California College of the Arts in 2004, and was recently an artist in residence at Crown Point Press (2006).

<p>GENESIS BREYER P-ORRIDGE : BLOOD - SEX - MAGIC</p>

<p>New exhibition by Genesis Breyer P-Orridge, who was born in Manchester in 1950 and now lives and works in New York. 
In the 1970s, a British MP described Genesis P-Orridge and his band Throbbing Gristle as “wreckers of Western civilization.” What was intended as an insult became an artistic principle. For 45 years now, Genesis P-Orridge has been at the front of aesthetic extremism. His microcosm includes the atonal noise attacks of Industrial Music granddaddy Throbbing Gristle, the post-psychedelic sound garlands of Psychic TV and performance activities, whose pleasure in breaking taboos is reminiscent of the Vienna Actionism movement.</p>

<p>BRUCE DAVIDSON - SUBWAY</p>

<p>In 1980 Bruce Davidson began photographing the New York subway system, venturing regularly into this intoxicating, sometimes dangerous subterranean world. At first Davidson photographed in black and white, but he soon realised colour was necessary to depict the intensity of this graffiti-covered landscape. Originally published in 1986, this updated Steidl edition of Subway is printed from new scans of Davidson’s Kodachrome slides and features additional images.</p>

<p>“Go back into the subway and look beyond the graffiti. Lift up your heads and look around, see what Bruce has revealed – the beauty in the subway population, the enormous amount of colour below and above ground, the varieties and pleasures to be seen from the subway. The shrill insistence of the noise in our ears and of the graffiti to our eyes does not end the catalogue of effects the subway has on our senses. Bruce Davidson has reopened and rewritten that catalogue with this magnificent series of photographs. Light, colour, humanity, affection, and hope can be added to our impressions of the New York subway system.” Henry Geldzahler</p>

<p>SHARON LOCKHART - LUNCH BREAK</p>

<p>Sharon Lockhart's complex and careful investigations into the mediums of film and photography probe the limits and intersections of both. For Lunch Break (2008), Lockhart spent a year at a naval shipbuilding plant in Maine, observing and engaging with workers during their daily routines. The photographs and film installation presented in this exhibition contemplate workers' activities during their time off from production, bringing into view everyday situations that typically escape our collective attention.</p>

<p>Lockhart's work is completely unsentimental yet deeply humane, focused on mundane details yet grounded in a contemporary political and economic reality: the decline of the American industrial working class in the context of 21st-century global capitalism.</p>

<p>The photographs in this exhibition were selected by Avedon in 1978 for the portfolio Avedon/Paris, on the eve of a retrospective exhibition of his fashion work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They depict celebrated beauties in high fashion, including Marlene Dietrich in Dior, Dorian Leigh in Piguet, and Suzy Parker in Lanvin-Castillo. These photographs exemplify Avedon’s innovative style during his earliest creative peak: his models are full of expression, smiling, laughing, and posed in action in the City of Light. Appearing in Harper's Bazaar at the height of its influence, his photographs were instrumental in changing the popular understanding of fashion. Indeed, their influence still resonates in the fashion magazines of today.</p>

<p>MICHAEL KENNA - VENEZIA</p>

<p>Michael Kenna’s work has often been described as enigmatic, graceful and hauntingly beautiful. The exhibition features 53 black and white images that demonstrate a skilled photographer’s ability to capture on film what we cannot see with our eyes, such as the movement of time and the presence of atmosphere.</p>

<p>Kenna has captured the essence of Venice, its romance, its miraculous existence and its crumbling beauty. Kenna’s long exposures, sometimes lasting several hours during the darkest hours of the night, smooth over the surfaces of the canals, further emphasizing their street-like function in this floating city. With typically meticulous prints, Kenna distills Venice to its iconic, elemental characteristics of water and light.</p>

<p>THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF BRETT WESTON</p>

<p>This exhibition celebrates the career of Brett Weston (1911-1993). The son of famed American photographer Edward Weston (1886-1958), Brett Weston was a "natural" with the camera. After serving as his father's apprentice, Brett was a teenager when he first received high-level, international recognition as an artist.</p>

<p>Over his long and prolific career, Brett Weston exemplified the modernist aesthetic. He used the medium in a resolutely "purist" manner: his preference was always for sharp lenses and beautifully modulated black-and-white prints. He applied this technical precision to a sustained exploration of the idea of abstraction. In recording the details of everyday things, rocks, plants, trees, water, peeled paint, the human figure. Weston sought to balance fact and form, objective reality and the beauty of abstraction. Through the graphic language of form, Weston aimed to suggest the deeper possibilities, and mysteries, of familiar things.</p>

<p>MOM &amp; DAD - TERRY RICHARDSON</p>

<p>Terry delves deeply and indiscriminately into the world with his camera revealing the all too personal nature of his life... his family life. 
Terry’s images don’t desist to shock, be it following his colourful yet frail mother or tracking his father’s life and the decline of his mental health though his last days.... Terry’s camera has no boundaries, no judgement, just the simple truth of the snapshot, an intimate portrait of his family and in turn more or less a self-portrait of Terry Richardson the son.<br>
Created as a double book, each book will be dedicated to one of his parents and feature a number of portraits and candid photos taken throughout their lives.</p>

<p>Published by Morel Books, the book will be limited to 1000 copies.</p>

<p>JULIUS SHULMAN - 80 YEARS OF PHOTOGRAPHY</p>

<p>This show will include not only his well-known photographs of works by architects such as Neutra, Koenig, Lautner, Frey, and Eames but also early images from Shulman’s personal files.<br>
Julius Shulman is widely regarded as the most important architectural photographer in history.  Over a seventy year career Shulman not only documented the work of many of the great architects of the 20th century, but he elevated the genre of commercial architectural photography to a fine art form.   It is illuminating to recognize the simple fact that the work of architects such as Neutra, Koenig, and Lautner are virtually known all over the world through the images and perspective of Julius Shulman.  As Neutra astutely observed, “His work will survive me.  Film is stronger and good glossy prints are easier to ship than brute concrete, stainless steel, or even ideas.”</p>

<p>JULIO BITTENCOURT - RAMOS</p>

<p>Piscinao de Ramos, or "Ramos Swimming Pool" as it is known in Portuguese, is an artificial salt-water lake located in an area called Ramos, amidst a vast area of favelas (shantytowns) in Rio de Janeiro. It is a public park consisting of artificial lake and surrounding beach, as well as a few soccer fields and other sports facilities. It was inaugurated in 2001 by the State Government of Rio de Janeiro and Petrobras (Brazil's national oil company), and to much controversy: many of Rio's inhabitants understood it to be a blatantly political act aimed at winning votes from the outskirts of the city. The immediate vicinity of the park is surrounded by 15 different favelas, run by competing factions of drug-trafficking gangs who operate as de facto governments within those communities. Although violence still plagues many of those favelas, the park itself has been mostly free of such problems, at least in and around the lake.</p>

<p>Ramos is crowded, noisy, and polluted, and known for its eccentric characters and an intense display of the beachside enjoyment for which Brazil is famous worldwide. Here, in this photoshop-free paradise, no social hierarchy exists to define what is cool and what is kitsch, it's all blended together by a common joie de vivre. Here what matters is not looking good for the camera, but rather feeling the sun on one's skin, getting drunk on cachaça (Brazilian rum), and splashing the time away.</p>

<p>JORN VANHOFEN</p>

<p>Only a few individuals appear in the quiet pictures by photographer Jörn Vanhöfen, or so it seems, at first glance. For behind the aesthetic charm of his visual compositions lies the ambiguity of their aesthetic, as well as the omnipresence of people in the age of globalization.</p>

<p>His landscapes are places man has affected, and then carelessly abandoned, forgotten, but they also depict places of transformation, such as the wildfires in Portugal, droughts, or marble mining in Carrera. With his leftovers, man has created landscapes that ravage, pollute, and supplant: mountains of junk, paper, and old tires; industrial ruins and deserted terrain in mega-metropolises. Vanhöfen creates unique, poetic photographs, which disturb us and question our experience of reality, because they avoid definition. And so his photographs shock us, while confronting “the modern, sentimental feeling about nature,” of which philosopher Georg Lukás has already said that it is “only the projection of experience and the self-made environment is no longer a home for mankind, but a prison.” Nature is no longer comforting, but the “historical, philosophical objectification of the alienation between mankind and his constructs.”</p>

<p>HELLEN VAN MEENE</p>

<p>The intimately scaled female portraits in the exhibition were all shot in Russia and in the artistʼs hometown of Heiloo, The Netherlands. Characteristic of van Meeneʼs style, the
portraits reflect an introspective mood, unveiling a moment of acute psychological poignancy. In Untitled, St. Petersburg (above), van Meene has returned to a model she previously photographed, whom the artist met in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2007.
Formerly a girl in the midst of awkward adolescence, she appears now both physically and psychologically exposed as a nude young woman, bright red lipstick and black wig her only staged adornment. Directly engaging the viewer, the modelʼs coolly blank expression and brilliant blue eyes offer an intriguing glimpse into her psyche.</p>

<p>Van Meene has elsewhere sought to expand her study of
photographic portraiture by turning to dogs as subjects. As with
her earliest portraits of teenagers, the artist has created an
outdoor studio with a simple background in order to focus on
the character of each dog and to highlight their idiosyncrasies.
Using a navy or crimson backdrop and an antique Persian
carpet, van Meene imbues the dogs with a measure of rank
and respect, while drawing out of them the same psychological
potential as her human portraits.</p>

<p>MADELEINE DE SINETY - PHOTOGRAPHS</p>

<p>During the past 40 years, photographer Madeleine de Sinéty has worked on several continents, quietly documenting the everyday lives and public events of those who reside in obscure rural corners of the world. This selection of 71 black-and-white and color images will be the first to explore the breadth of de Sinéty’s photographic essays, from her multi-year exploration of traditional French farm families in a small region of Brittany, to village life in Uganda, and finally to the work of a single logger in northern Maine who still uses draft horses to pull this precious natural resource from the woods.</p>

<p>On the lighter side of life in Maine, de Sinéty has also documented the famed photographer and conceptual artist William Wegman, at work in Rangeley making large Polaroid portraits of his dogs. De Sinéty has been a resident of Rangeley, Maine for the past 30 years. This exhibition is the fourth in a series of exhibitions called Circa that explores compelling aspects of contemporary art in the state of Maine and beyond.</p>

<p>DAVID LEVINTHAL: ATTACK OF THE BRICKS: STAR WARS</p>

<p>Familiar Star Wars characters are the subjects of Levinthal’s most recent series. However, these epic visages are composed of Legos, as Levinthal has in his signature fashion transformed these miniature action figures into powerful action heroes. These photos mimic the cinematic style of the Lucas films, transforming tiny bricks into legendary, larger-than-life Sci Fi stars.</p>

<p>Contrast is central to this series, as the figures are placed in front of monochromatic black backgrounds. The lighting is sharp, resulting in even more intimidating intergalactic machines, weapons, and their famed operators. The black and white walls of the exhibition’s installation further emphasize this contrast. Levinthal's standard use of a narrow depth of field, soft focus, and the photographic trope of enlargement seen in his close-up shots bring a sense of life to the objects in the foreground. However, he does not attempt to completely remove all traces of the Lego aesthetic, allowing his viewers to see what is at play in his creation and representation of “outer space.” The photos showcase the humanized drama such toys have to offer to the imaginative.</p>

<p>ANNIKA VON HAUSSWOLFF - OVERHAUL</p>

<p>The exhibition consists of photographic documents of houses and places left behind. Abandoned by the people who once inhabited them, urban explorers and graffiti artists are now the only ones who enter these buildings through closed doors and windows. In spite of the lack of legitimate activity in these places, the photographs provide a narrative of man’s symbiosis with the buildings she erects. These are temporary abodes which like train stations accompany our journey through life. In this context the title OVERHAUL becomes both a statement and a question. Is our world in urgent need of renovation or is an improvement already in progress?</p>

<p>The documentary imagery has been von Hausswolff’s principal characteristic but her photographs have until now always been carefully staged with a clear conceptual approach. Her new body of work is both clearly rooted in her early fascination for documentary photography inspired by photographers like Anders Petersen and Christer Strömholm but they are also leaving the last decades of staged imagery behind. Still though, many elements in von Hausswolff’s new works refer to her early works.</p>

<p>In these works, ritualized exorcisms are performed by Nakadate and her cast of amateur actors. Locations shift from dingy, claustrophobic motel rooms to the majestic open spaces of the American West. There are ecstatic dances, woodland walks, train travels, and reluctant stripteases. Unwanted feelings and bad memories are cast away.</p>

<p>The show also includes a variety of photographs: the FEVER DREAMS series, large images that Nakadate shot while making her videos and the LUCKY TIGER series, small snapshots in which she appears in suggestive poses inspired by 1950s-style cheesecake and camera-club photos. These snapshots were completed during a performance in which the artist and anonymous middle-aged men, enlisted via Craigslist.com, covered their hands with fingerprinting ink and touched the photographs together. Sitting in a circle, on the floor of one man’s living room, they passed the snapshots around, like trading cards.</p>

<p>LUIGI GHIRRI - PROJECT PRINTS</p>

<p>Luigi Ghirri Project Prints will be both a journey through Ghirri’s work and through Italy. During the 1980s the concept of landscape became increasingly important for Ghirri. He sought to create a new iconography of the Italian landscape, one that could incorporate both tradition and modernity. In the important series Paesaggio Italiano, many images from which are included in this exhibition, Ghirri looked to evoke a particular sense of place. He wrote, “I would like this work on the Italian landscape to seem more about the perception of a place than its cataloguing or description.”</p>

<p>In the early 1980s Ghirri started to use a medium format camera producing larger negatives, clearly not for the sake of technique itself, but as if to “get inside” the subject more intensely. The centrality of thought and the sense of the project continued to be the necessary conditions for his work during those years, to such an extent that these negatives actually turned out to be another project tool he could resort to. Thanks to these matrices Ghirri was able to produce excellent contact prints, small photographs that he could cut out, file and line up in order to see each image, plan his series, organize his own view, even leaving them loose and then bringing them together again in endless combinations. These small photographs that enabled Luigi Ghirri to organize his own view from the early 1980s until 1992 were the Project Prints.</p>

Well-known from his projects Black Photo Album/Look at me: 1890-1900s, Township Billboards: Beauty, sex and cell phones, Trauma Landscapes and Chasing Shadows, the South African artist took the opportunity of the invitation for this show and the production of his first comprehensive monograph, to delve deep into his artistic archive.</p>

<p>Santu Mofokeng, Chasing Shadows - 30 years of photographic essays, presents a selection of more than 200 images (photographs and a slideshow), texts and documents. The photographic essays he composed over the years, some of which are a life-long work in progress, range from the Soweto of his youth, from his investigations of life on the farms, the everyday life of the township and in particular, representations of the self and family histories of black South Africans, to images from the artist’s ongoing exploration of religious rituals and of typologies of landscapes, including his most current project Radiant Landscapes, commissioned specially for this retrospective.</p>

<p>BORDERS - A PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBIT</p>

<p>In this exhibit Noah Kalina, Emily Shur, and Noe Montes all deal with the ideas of borders in the photography.</p>

<p>Noah Kalina deals with the border between still and video, performance art and photography. He uses the traditional border of a still photo with the camera on a tripod and incorporates a story with movement inside that frame. Each video is 1 shot and no editing; a friend lying on a couch as another friends rides around her in circles; Noah doing pushups in his new studio; a young couple holding hands, knee deep in the ocean staring straight at the camera, still for 1 minute.</p>

<p>Emily Shur is showing pieces from her “Nature Calls” series, which are photos of cellphone tower trees in their environment. These scenes blur the line between nature, business, the need for communication, and the need to feel as if we are surrounded by nature in the built environment.</p>

<p>Noe Montes photographed objects around his parents home in Yuma Arizona and scenes in El Paso Texas while visiting these areas which he grew up in and around. These objects represent the border between the hopes and dreams of a new object and the reality of it being discarded or sat on a shelf unnoticed for years. Seemingly mundane, an old boom box on a couch, a broken touchtone telephone, and a statue of a horse head on a shelf, these are the same things he returns to each time he visits, which bring back the memories of home and family for better or for worse before he moved away.</p>

<p>ANGELS RIBE - IN THE LABYRINTH</p>

<p>This exhibition by Àngels Ribé covers a period of her production from the late 1960s to the mid-eighties.<br> It is centred on relatively unknown works that are nevertheless significant for the artist's body of work as a whole and for the development of contemporary art in our country. At the end of the sixties, a new aesthetic model appeared that had a fundamental influence on the creation of new ways of conceiving the artistic practice. The associative and symbolic functions of art are renegotiated: the artwork ceases to be an autonomous entity, as was the norm in the modernist tradition, and its meaning becomes dependent on an interchange with the spectator. In this way, the ambiguity and the multiplicity of references and readings that are an intrinsic part of the work of art are revealed.</p>

<p>ALAN ABOUD - ABOVE ALL ELSE</p>

<p>This summer exhibit at Paul Smith Globe, displays a series of photographs taken by Aboud from 2002-2011 on board flights travelling to cities including New York, Beirut, Nice, Milan and Tokyo.</p>

<p>From his seat Aboud captures a moment of open calmness and clarity in the airborne images, which is somewhat at odds with the drone and clatter of the closed atmosphere you would expect within the cabin. The variations of the content and composition; the sky, a presence of sun or cloud, a flash of engine or wing, strengthens the power of the repeated image with a subject matter most apt for the location of this project.</p>

<p>Alan Aboud was born in Dublin in 1966. He graduated from Saint Martin’s School of Art in 1989 and started his own creative agency shortly afterward; Paul Smith was one of his first clients.</p>

<p>Based in London, he has worked extensively in Europe, Japan and the USA, producing award-winning advertising, graphic &amp; product design, commercials and motion imagery for a variety of clients in the fashion, beauty and music industries.</p>

<p>Paul Smith Globe at Heathrow's Terminal 5 reflects Paul’s eclectic taste and houses a collection of items he has gathered on his travels around the world alongside all the Paul Smith collections.
A unique art wall is in place where people can view antique art, modern prints designed by illustrators and photography, some taken by Paul himself.</p>

<p>Exhibition runs through to September 20th, 2011</p>

<p>JAMES CASEBERE: CREDIT, FAITH, TRUST</p>

<p>Working at the forefront of constructed photography since the late seventies, Casebere is associated with The Pictures Generation, a group of artists who combined a Pop obsession with media culture with the critical framework of Conceptual Art to redefine photography as a Postmodern medium in the 70s and 80s. Based upon his understanding of architectural, anthropological, art historical and cinematic sources, Casebere’s detailed photographs address contemporary and historical social concerns. His work challenges the boundaries between reality and imagination, whether dealing with alienation in sixties America; addressing slavery and colonialism through black and white visions of cotton mills and covered wagons peppered with native American arrows; or questioning incarceration and the significance of state buildings.</p>

<p>In the Landscape with Houses series, the artist expresses a fascination with the vernacular notion of home. The images are carefully constructed compositions based on a recreation of the suburban area of Dutchess County in Upstate New York as a model in the artist’s studio. As one might reconstruct an experience of landscape from memory, the model houses were created one by one and only later placed on a set, reassembled in different configurations. Colours, architectural features and details, and the relative scale of parts were revisited several times, resulting in a pastiche of the ideal suburban neighbourhood.</p>

<p>LEE FRIEDLANDER: AMERICA BY CAR</p>

<p>This will be Friedlanderʼs first solo exhibition in London since his 1976 show at the Photographersʼ Gallery.<br>
This exhibition charts numerous journeys made by the photographer during the last decade across most of the fifty US states. Shot entirely from the interiors of rental cars, typically from the driver’s seat, Friedlander makes use of side and rearview mirrors, windscreens, and side windows as framing devices for a total of 192 images.</p>

<p>Elements from car interiors such as steering wheels and dashboards, as well as leather or wood panel trim, provide an index of their own; these differing qualities of finish and contemporaneity often appear strikingly at odds with the terrains in which they are located. Presented in the square-crop format that characterizes Friedlander’s more recent work, these images complicate and invigorate the most bereft of rural scenes. His desire to collapse and flatten out the three dimensional world parallels the means of cubist painting and recalls the collaging techniques of pop art.</p>

<p>WELL HUNG - TYLER SHIELDS &amp; MAXIMILIAN WIEDEMANN</p>

<p>Tyler Shields is coming to Central London to join forces with Maximilian Wiedemann in an exhibition which will release never before seen controversial images of Lindsay Lohan by Tyler and the pair's collaboration with those images.<br>
Tyler Shields is famous for his blood bath and porn star images of Lindsay Lohan, taken while she was appearing in court, which she was forced to defend as art. The latest images, to be displayed for the first time at Imitate Modern in London, W1, will stir up as much of a publicity storm which Maximilian will add his own brand of wry humour and subversion to.<br>
Maximilian is famous for turning culturally iconic images or brands on their heads, thus revealing information which is often more truthful than the original image. Max and Tyler's collaboration on images of Lindsay Lohan reveal a cutting insight into society's harmful manipulation of celebrity for money and the human cost of such.</p>

<p>IAN BERRY - THIS IS WHITECHAPEL</p>

<p>In 1972 the Whitechapel Gallery commissioned British photographer Ian Berry, renowned for his coverage of conflict, to turn his lens to everyday life in east London. He captured the last members of a dwindling Jewish community and the arrival of new faces from the Caribbean and South Asia; slum clearances heralding brutal high-rise towers; pineapples appearing in a greengrocer’s window; and a cobbler meeting the demands of a growing youth culture with star-spangled platform heels.</p>

<p>This is Whitechapel presents photographs and archive material from Berry’s momentous commission revealing the poverty, the acts of kindness and community and the political tensions that are still evident today.</p>

<p>KEN GRIFFITHS - PATAGONIA</p>

<p>In 2001 and 2002 photographer Ken Griffiths set out on three expeditions to the Argentine province of Chubut, the heartland of Welsh Patagonia.  Ken visited Chubut in different seasons of the year to follow the trails blazed south and west by intrepid young Welsh pioneers. Between 1870 and 1900 they travelled the interior of the country and reached the Andes along what is now the Chilean frontier.</p>

<p>Ken decided that he wanted to avoid all the clichés of photo-journalists who travel to Gaiman for a day or two, visit a Welsh tea-room, and come back. Instead he was determined to set out to record, in image, the entire scope of the Welsh achievement in that part of the New World. Ken’s family left Wales for New Zealand and he has now made England his home for several decades.  As an immigrant himself, Ken was moved from the outset by the quest of the Welsh for a home where they could preserve their culture and their language.</p>

<p>ERNST HAAS - COLOR CORRECTION</p>

<p>Ernst Haas is unquestionably one of the best-known, most prolific and most published photographers of the twentieth century.
He is most associated with a vibrant colour photography which, for decades, was much in demand by the
illustrated press. His colour work, published in the most influential magazines in Europe and America, also fed a constant stream of books, and these too enjoyed great popularity. But although his colour work earned him fame around the world, in recent decades it has often been derided by critics and curators as “overly commercial”, and too easily accessible – or in the language of curators, not sufficiently “serious”. As a result, his reputation has suffered in comparison with a younger generation of colour photographers, notably Eggleston, Shore and Meyerowitz.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, however, there was also a side of his work that was almost entirely hidden from view. Parallel to his commissioned work Haas constantly made images for his own interest, and these pictures show an entirely different aspect of Haas’s sensibility: they are far more edgy, loose, complex and ambiguous – in short, far more radical than the work which earned him fame.</p>

<p>ABOUT FACE</p>

<p>About Face, is a group show featuring twenty-five contemporary photographers:  Steven Alvarez, Tina Barney, Rita Bernstein, Donald E.

<p>This exhibition concentrates on recent portraiture concerned with the face. There are few things more varied and interesting than the face. It embodies our individuality and projects it to the world in a way that nothing else does. Yet at the same time, there are few things more ubiquitous than a face. We are confronted with other faces (and occasionally our own) on such a routine basis that we stop examining them with any great amount of care. Like buildings in a city, only the most striking ones stand out, and the rest blend together as part of the context of daily life.</p>

<p>CHRISTIAN GIERATHS - SALAAM BOMBAY</p>

<p>The exhibition´s title Salaam Bombay derives from a film title of the 1980s which reflects Gieraths´ interest in locations for the Hindi film industry, located in Mumbai.<br>
Christian Gieraths is a flaneur who is interested in the hustle and bustle of a society which develops itself in the pulse of technological progress and which, therefore, is in an ongoing condition of change. He is continuously searching for places where he can find these changes manifested in its historical, political or aesthetic forms. Sotchi, Havanna, Tokyo, Hollywood and Las Vegas have been previous settings of earlier series´ which show a similar picture language: They show deserted places, streets and interiors as well as facades. His focal point of the compositions is always identical. Hence, the viewpoint of the observer as well as the restricted image section remains Gieraths´ criteria for composition. His photographies are comprised by a certain silence that derives from his composition and reminds of film stills.</p>

<p>Colour and atmosphere as well as the artist´s viewpoint are most significant. By depicting his compositions in a short span of time he enables the past to become present. Through dealing with these locations and its surroundings, as well as thoughtful observations of the sensual reality and the atmospheric moods, Gieraths transforms his visual experience into photography.</p>

<p>Both Polonia and Other Fables and Walking on Water by US photographer Allan Sekula, explore personal themes rooted in the artist’s Polish ancestry, placed amidst wider considerations of national identity, migration and global economics.</p>

<p>The exhibition is made up of a series of large, square-format analogue photographs; a text booklet and wall-mounted quotations, alongside an installation of slide projection. The artist uses a range of photographic tropes, from clandestine snapshots to formal portraiture, from ethnography to street photography, from serial to aerial views in an attempt to understand Poland, the place, and the Poland that lives in the minds of those who have left.</p>

<p>DUFFY: A VISUAL RECORD OF A PHOTOGRAPHIC GENIUS</p>

<p>During the ‘60s and ’70s, Brian Duffy (1933-2010) was, along with David Bailey and Terence Donovan, a member of the fashion photography elite. His docu-style shoots for Vogue and Queen magazines were aimed at dispelling the gloom of the post-war period and provided a self-consciously youthful, visually literate generation with a new sense of self, and of London. Duffy gave up photography in 1979, at the height of his career, and set fire to most of his work in his back garden.</p>

<p>His son, Chris, spent years searching through archives and publications all over the world to produce ‘Duffy: In His Own Words’, published this month by ACC Editions. Among Duffy’s most iconic images were those used in campaigns for Benson &amp; Hedges and Smirnoff, a series of studio images of Michael Caine shot in 1964 and the covers for David Bowie’s ‘Aladdin Sane’, ‘Lodger’ and ‘Scary Monsters’ albums.<br>To coincide with the book’s release, ‘Duffy: A Visual Record of a Photographic Genius’, the first and only book of the photographer's work.</p>

<p>JANE AND LOUISE WILSON</p>

<p>This exhibition of large-scale photographs is from their ongoing investigation into the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. The exhibition also features a number of other works, many previously unseen in the UK.</p>

<p>Atomgrad (Nature Abhors a Vacuum), 2010 is a suite of eight photographic prints depicting deserted interiors from the abandoned town of Pripyat, situated within the 30km wide Exclusion Zone around the site of the disaster. Books remain on shelves and desks, bed frames remain intact and once-exquisite parquet flooring lies on the ground like rubble. A yardstick appears within each image and is a recurring motif throughout the exhibition. These objects of measurement – functional yet obsolete – act as a marker of scale and order, alluding to the tensions between association and analysis, memory and material fact.</p>

<p>THOMAS STRUTH: PHOTOGRAPHS 1978-2010</p>

<p>Picturing subjects as diverse as places of worship, jungles and research laboratories, Struth once compared the space shuttle programme to the construction of the medieval cathedrals. His photographs reveal the cultural, psychological and historical undercurrents beneath the surface of modernity.</p>

<p>Tracing the architectural history of ordinary city streets Struth also charts the increasing uniformity of global development. While people are absent from his street scenes of Düsseldorf, Naples or New York, they take centre stage in his family portraits and his iconic museum photographs showing spectators lost in devotional gaze before works of art and architecture. In sharp contrast, his Paradise series captures impenetrable forests void of any trace of human intervention.</p>

<p>This exhibition spans early black and white prints to recent colour photographs that are up to 4 metres long. These include images of sites at the cutting edge of technology such as the Space Centre on Cape Canaveral. Their overwhelming scale evokes an industrial sublime; built by us, yet chillingly inhuman, these structures encapsulate the great contradictions of progress.</p>

<p>DAIDO MORIYAMA: ON THE ROAD</p>

<p>This exhibition traces the trajectory of Moriyama Daido's career as a photographer from his debut in photography magazines in 1965 to the present, based primarily on developments over about a dozen of his photobooks. <br>
While the subject of Moriyama's photographs is almost always fragments of daily life that he discovers on the street, his works violently jolt the viewer, and have helped expand the concept of photography. They are also imbued with a power that inspires us to reexamine the essence of photography.</p>

<p>Among the over 400 works on display will be some new, and for Moriyama, rare color photographs that deal with the theme of Tokyo.</p>

<p>Others, such as Károly Escher, Rudolf Balogh and Jószef Pécsi remained in Hungary producing high-quality and innovatory photography. A display of approximately two hundred photographs ranging in date from c.1914–c.1989 will explore stylistic developments in photography and chart key historical events.

<p>JOSEF KOUDELKA - INVASION 68 : PRAGUE</p>

<p>In 1968 Josef Koudelka was thirty years old. He had committed himself to photography as a full-time career only recently, and had been chronicling the theater and the lives of gypsies, but he had never photographed a news event. That all changed on the night of August 21, when Warsaw Pact tanks invaded the city of Prague, ending the short-lived political freedom in Czechoslovakia that came to be known as the Prague Spring.<br>
In the midst of the turmoil of the Soviet-led invasion, Koudelka took to the streets to document this critical moment.
Koudelka’s photographs of the invasion were miraculously smuggled out of the country. A year after they reached New York, Magnum Photos distributed the images, but credited them to an unknown Czech photographer to avoid reprisals. The intensity and significance of the images earned the still-anonymous photographer the Robert Capa Award.</p>

<p>Sixteen years would pass before Koudelka could safely acknowledge authorship.</p>

<p>BEATE GÜTSCHOW</p>

<p>Her photography addresses the construction of imagery, both within the medium itself, through the use of digital and analogue technologies, and the cultural conditions that influence the creation of imagery. Gütschow's compositions reference 17th Century landscape painting as well as the architectural and documen-
tary photography of the1950s and '60s.</p>

<p>She draws from her archive of mostly analogue images of buildings, trees, landscapes and people to assemble digital composites. At first glance the final works appear convincing as real scenes, but on closer inspection the spaces and scenes are not quite genuine, causing the constructed nature of imagery to become apparent.</p>

<p>LAURIE SIMMONS - THE LOVE DOLL: DAYS 1 – 30</p>

<p>This will also be the artist’s first solo exhibition in London. Over the last 30 years Simmons has garnered a significant reputation internationally as one of the leading artists to emerge from the New York ‘Pictures Generation’ during the 1970’s and 80’s.</p>

<p>Laurie Simmons moved to New York in 1973, with her close friend and photographer Jimmy De Sana. The two artists converted an old sweatshop in Soho into their studio and living space. Together the pair set up Laurie’s first darkroom, and under De Sana’s tutelage, Simmons came to understand, with a far greater awareness, the intricacies of the camera and the complexities of production techniques. From 1975, Laurie began to photograph her dolls in these evocative nourish black-and-white scenarios. Whilst the resultant images were beautifully intricate alter-realities, the artist was amazed by their apparent realism – ‘I actually believed that the rooms I was shooting could be mistaken for real places’. Simmons was immediately struck by the camera’s propensity to lie – and indeed the role images constitute in our own construction as subjects – whether it be as sons, daughters, family members or citizens.</p>

<p>AXEL HÜTTE - FRANKFURT 2011 // EMETH</p>

<p>In the show Frankfurt 2011 // Emeth (in Hebrew Emeth stands for "truth" - Meth means "death"), the works as a whole focus on the rapid changes of environmental reality, the alteration of urban and natural landscapes and the reception of the visible reality. In "Tableau Frankfurt am Main", 2011 Axel Hütte brings together postcards picturing the city before the 2nd World War with his own photographs of the present views of the city. By opposing images from different decades the artist hints us towards the diverse modes of representational images and the changes within the visual perception. Consequently and in an ironic way, Hütte chooses the format of an overdimensioned postcard - an out-dated medium of mass communication in today's society.</p>

<p>The perfectly composed photographs of nighttime cityscapes integrated by Axel Hütte feature the particular skyline of Frankfurt. Like all nighttime photographs of Axel Hütte those pictures were taken with extremely long exposure time - also in details one can find the examination of the notion of time which reveals the hidden and focuses the perception.The artificial lights illuminating the darkness in "Ratskeller", 2011 create a shifting moment in the perception and constitute an irritating, magical atmosphere. Although the scene is deserted, or precisely because of the absence of people strong energy emanates from the image.</p>

<p>BRYAN GRAF - FIELD RECORDINGS</p>

<p>The title of the show refers to a term for audio recordings made outside of the studio, sometimes involving the ambient sounds of nature. In this instance it refers to the onsite interactions of photographic materials with a particular place.</p>

<p>The body of work, Wildlife Analysis, was made in the woods and swamps around New Jersey. While photographing these places with black and white film, Graf used unexposed color film to record the direct contact of ambient light flooding onto the film without the use of a lens. Graf then uses the exposed color film as a composite layer in the darkroom. Using these tools he take us on a hallucinatory trip through his native landscape. The images themselves are obstructed by a river of intoxicating hues, blending and shifting as they wash across the prints.<br>
 Additionally, a selection of Polaroids, from The Sun Room: Interchanges, B-Sides &amp; Remixes series gives us a glimpse into Graf's studio practice. He refers to these images as "sketches” made in and around his studio, which doubles as a sun room for plants in the spring and summer months. These images are small-scale experiments made over the past four years while he was working on various projects.</p>

<p>ARNOLD CRANE</p>

<p>Over a period of more than two decades, Crane created a body of artistic work of immeasurable value and historic importance. Whether sitting in a car with Paul Strand, catching Imogen Cunningham in her kitchen or accompanying Ansel Adams on a Point Lobos shoot, Crane always managed to produce sensitive photographs that both revealed and revered his subjects.</p>

<p>Crane has worked as a photographer since his youth and documented incidents such as major crime scenes, earthquakes, fires and political events and was published in various U.S. magazines. After receiving his Doctor of Juris prudence, he temporarily stopped working as a photographer, but started again in 1983, inspired by a friendship with the photographer Man Ray. His monograph On the Other Side of the Camera, already out of print, offers a complete collection of all the artists’ portraits Crane has created over the years. The book won the renowned KODAK Photo Book Award in 1995, the year of its publication.</p>

<p>NAN GOLDIN - FIRE LEAP</p>

<p>Fireleap is a major new slideshow with images of children from 1972 until today, most of which have never been shown. Children fascinate Goldin because of their freedom. They follow no rules, living in a free zone before being socialized by society’s boundaries. Fireleap captures this consciousness while it is still untethered by awkwardness and social restraint.</p>

<p>Nan Goldin is known as an artist whose output is inextricably bound up with her own biography, and for breaking down the traditional barrier between the camera and what is being photographed. Her naturally lit images document her surrogate family of friends and lovers, and more often than not are frank confrontations with personal experience, and explorations of both intimacy and the alienation that can be wound up within it.</p>

<p>This exhibition focuses on Richard Avedon’s portraits of writers, first executed in between the 1950’s and the 1970’s
During a career that spanned nearly sixty years, Richard Avedon defined and expanded concepts of art and culture in twentieth century photography while producing an extended meditation on life, death, beauty, class, race, and identity. His reportage, portrait and commercial work dissolved the lines between photography’s many perceived genres, as it ranged across a breadth of subject matter including fashion, the American Civil Rights movement, war protestors, the fall of the Berlin wall, and portraits of the famous and the anonymous.</p>

<p>BORIS MIKHAILOV - CASE HISTORY</p>

<p>Ukrainian-born Boris Mikhailov is one of the leading photographers from the former Soviet Union. For over 30 years, he has explored the position of the individual within the historical mechanisms of public ideology, touching on such subjects as Ukraine under Soviet rule, the living conditions in post-communist Eastern Europe, and the fallen ideals of the Soviet Union. Although deeply rooted in a historical context, Mikhailov’s work also incorporates profoundly engaging and personal narratives of humor, lust, vulnerability, aging, and death.</p>

<p>This exhibition is the first in-depth presentation of Mikhailov’s seminal Case History series (1997–98) in an American museum. This body of work explores the deeply troubling circumstances of people who have been left homeless by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Set against the bleak backdrop of the industrial city of Kharkov, Mikhailov’s life-size color photographs document the oppression, devastating poverty, and everyday reality of a disenfranchised community living on the margins of Russia’s new economic regime.</p>

<p>ALL THAT FITS: THE AESTHETICS OF JOURNALISM</p>

<p>The exhibition presents the provocative idea that art and journalism are two sides of a unique activity; the production and distribution of images and information. The exhibition brings to surface how images and information are communicated, and the aesthetic principles used in the act of transmission. Whereas journalism provides a view on the world, as it ‘really’ is; art often presents a view on the view, truth posited as acts of reflection. All that Fits: The Aesthetics of Journalism will examine both as systems of information that define truth in terms of the visible but also what can be imagined.</p>

<p>YANNIS ROGER - APRES. PHOTOGRAPHS, 2004-2010</p>

<p>Taken on artist’s wanderings, Yannis Roger’s pictures, often miniature and always beautifully printed on Ilfochrome paper, witness with a rare poetry a silent and personal world at the border of commonplace, intimate and strangeness. The photographer is a musician as well, but music informs his pictures much less than cinema. However, no will to impose a story through a juxtaposition of images. On the contrary, each photograph is a kind of photogram inviting the viewer to solve an enigma.</p>

<p>ORI GERSHT - FALLING PETALS</p>

<p>In his most recent series comprised of images taken from April to May 2010 in Japan, Gersht traveled between cities that were affected by World War II as well as ancient locations in remote western Japan, examining the shifting symbolism of the cherry blossom. While initially associated with Buddhist concepts of renewal, the celebration of life, and good fortune, the cherry blossom was re-appropriated during Japan's 19th century militarization and colonial expansion. Once celebrated as a healthy and abundant flower, the falling of the petals from the tree became the symbol of Kamikaze soldiers. Gersht furthers this discussion of life and death symbolism in his exploration of trees planted before the war in unaffected remote areas, contrasting them against trees in Hiroshima that were planted in nuclear soil.</p>

<p>The artist made use of digital cameras that allowed for images to be taken under extreme light conditions, further questioning the ability of photography as a medium to convey a singular truth or story. Presenting documentation of what is assumed to be an exact location, Gersht’s digital process allows for the absolute light and color veracity of these landscapes to be questioned and by extension the viewer’s interpretation of this location’s history. Unlike previous series which focused on geographic journeys (Walter Benjamin following the Lister Route in Gersht’s Evaders (2009) or The Forest (2006), in which the artist’s family found refuge from Nazi persecution during WWII in the Ukraine), Falling Petals offers imagery that conveys past and present without a specified linear narrative; Gersht’s photographic process implies the passage of time without providing an exacting start or finish to the life of the depicted.</p>

<p>ELLEN KOOI - OUT OF SIGHT</p>

<p>This new body of work continues Kooi's exploration of the Dutch landscape as well as her ability to create hyper realities. Kooi situates people in natural settings and through distinct technical feats creates narratives that recall fairytales, movies and dreams.</p>

<p>These large scale photographs, which are always shot in the daytime, allude to various tales that are hinted at but never revealed. Kooi's background in theatre is evident by the way she stages her photographs. Using a large format camera, she sets up elaborate lighting to create a set within the natural landscape. She stages the character(s) to dramatize and bring into focus the moods and stories of the scenes being created. The natural elements are transformed, becoming more than mere backdrops. Kooi's intense method of producing and processing her images exaggerates the unnerving realness of the situations being depicted.</p>

<p>ANTTI LAITINEN - BARK BOAT</p>

<p>Antti Laitinen latest performance entitled "Bark Boat", is documented through a series of photographs and video.<br>
On the 7th of August 2010 at 4am, a rudimentary and yet authentic sailboat was launched for the first time in the Finnish peninsula of Porkkala and was about to embark on its inaugural journey across the Gulf of Finland. At its command was a young and resilient journeyman who has made a name for himself through his adventurous-spirit and his ritualistic quests for achievement, and known by the name of Antti Laitinen.</p>

<p>This is the latest in a series of performances where Antti Laitinen embarks on a personal journey, pushing the boundaries of his physical endurance and braving the natural elements, to engage with the world in a collective mission to stage mythologies and erase the boundary between success and failure. As in most of his previous projects, "Bark Boat" originates from classical Finnish tales and cultural imagery - in this instance, the title is taken from a Finnish childhood game whereby pieces of tree bark are used as rafts and are set sailing onto the vast sea until they disappear out of sight. The children would imagine their miniature boats sailing all the way to faraway lands.</p>

<p>PAUL TREVOR - LIKE YOU'RE NEVER BEEN AWAY</p>

<p>This exhibition features 58 photographs of children playing on the streets of 1970s Liverpool.
In 1975 Paul Trevor came to Liverpool to document inner city deprivation for the 'Survival Programmes' project. His remarkable photographs tell a different story however. Their backdrop may be the dereliction of post-war Liverpool. But these images go beyond this bleak cityscape and get close to his real subject: families and children.</p>

<p>Paul's direct and honest street photography shows life as it was lived in a community defiant in the face of poverty, unemployment and the state of their surroundings. He depicts a place where the streets and wastelands became playgrounds, the family was a constant, and where children seem fun-loving and free.</p>

<p>PHILIP-LORCA DICORCIA : ROID</p>

<p>‘Roid’ by American artist Philip-Lorca diCorcia, reveals a series of over 100 never-before-seen Polaroids. Displayed along a rail that traces the contours of the gallery walls, the Polaroids span the 30-year career of one of the most influential photographers of his generation.</p>

<p>DiCorcia first came to prominence in the 1970s with photographs that defied definition, existing in the space between documentary fact and movie-style fiction. The meticulous staging of quotidian scenes of family and friends lent the images an unparalleled sense of heightened drama and ambiguity. In the 1990s diCorcia turned his focus from scenes of domesticity to the American tradition of street photography exemplified by photographers such as Robert Frank and Gary Winogrand. In a seminal series that was retrospectively entitled 'Hustlers', diCorcia photographed men who had moved to Hollywood seeking their fortune, only to find themselves working the Sunset Strip as male prostitutes.</p>

<p>GILES PRICE : MACROSCOPIC OLYMPIAD</p>

<p>"Macroscopic Olympiad" is a selection of photographs from a documentary project by Giles Price, which portrays a large scale and minutely detailed aerial vision of the Olympic Park during a period of rapid construction.<br>This visual language is only available through flight, reiterating the smallness not only of the physical being, but of the interior perspective on navigating a landscape." Merging the landscape with group portraiture, mini-scenes with human workers intersperse amidst the machines and structures. Unlike computer models made up of composite images, the images capture the breadth of the mega-project on several compositional levels in moments of real time, by offering an alternate vision of the Olympic construction process.</p>

<p>MICHAEL KENNA - RETROSPECTIVE</p>

<p>Michael Kenna`s retrospective covers the most significant periods of his creative work and shows famous landscape photos, made during his travels. Pictures of French provinces and Japanese gardens, American power plants and sculptures in St. Petersburg are among them.</p>

<p>The photographer’s style can be called metaphysical photography, with time and memory as basic concepts. Black-and-white high contrast photos take viewers from the real world to the abstract university of the photographer. Therefore, Kenna’s works can be easily regarded as an ancient painting and a 3D image. They embody the skilful synthesis of the eternal and the momentary. The photographer’s approach to the viewer is also specific. All photos by Kenna have small size. Such format forces one person to watch it from the distance of no more than 30 cm. Kenna intentionally brings us closer to the picture, demanding maximum involvement and frankness in the dialogue with the audience.</p>

<p>Leppala's images belong to a space that lies in between the visually perceptible world and a kind of mythical zone behind it. Her scenarios allow us a mere glimpse of events. By focusing on a single detail or gesture, she opens up her pictures to the viewer’s own interpretation.</p>

<p>Figures are shown in undefined interiors, their faces turned away and hidden behind their own hands or masks, mysterious in their inwardly directed, reserved aura. At times, they can hardly be discerned behind dense fields of wheat or bushes, while at other times they are lost in the light and shadow of infinite forests. The stillness and melancholy unique to the north is articulated in many of Leppälä’s nature photographs.</p>

<p>ALMAGUL MENLIBAYEVA - TRANSOXIANA DREAMS</p>

<p>In Transoxiana Dreams, Menlibayeva, a pictorial sorceress herself, breeds an eccentric storyline and fantastical imagery extracted deeply from her own atavistic repertoire, and leading visionally through an existing, yet unimaginable landscape in a distant and hypnagogic world. <br>Menlibayeva tells the tale of a young fisherman’s daughter who observes the dramatic changes to the landscape of the Aral region and its population through a child’s eyes in a dreamlike mélange of documentary and fantasy. Drawing on the image of the Greek mythological figure of the Centaur, Menlibayeva creates alluring hybrid beings, both sexually charged and bizarre alike. According to the legend, when the ancient Greeks first encountered the nomads of the Transoxianian Steppes on their horses, they initially believed them to be mythological quadruped, part person part animal, fearing their savage and magical powers.</p>

<p>JOHN HUMBLE - OTHER PLACES / VENICE BEACH</p>

<p>With Other Places, Humble decided to broaden his scope and "drive around the United States and photograph the American Landscape." Previously, his work was created with a large view camera, but advancements in digital photography enabled him to make his new photos with a hand-held camera, allowing more freedom and mobility. Humble made a series of extensive trips, staying primarily on smaller country roads. It is, of course, significant that his explorations were made in a car, and that his discoveries have become part of a great tradition in American photographic road trips.<br>Like his observations in Los Angeles, these American pictures are about insights in juxtaposition; aged and vacant storefronts sit beside gaudy drive-thrus, hand-painted religious billboards stand in empty fields, as do newly constructed, box-like churches that look more like concrete-slab industrial parks.</p>

<p>As a counterpoint to Humble's photographs of Middle America, he will concurrently present a series of photographs of Venice Beach. As the artist describes it, "there is no place in the world like the tawdry three-ring circus of Venice...electric guitar players on rollerblades, marijuana doctors, tarot readers, muscle builders, tattoo shops, drug addicts, entertainers, and people speaking every language under the sun."</p>

<p>TARA DARBY - LITERARY JOURNEY</p>

<p>Darby's Literary Journey series recounts her travels through towns and cities used as settings in great books of American 20th century literature. Her first journey followed Truman Capote's In Cold Blood and was recounted episodically on the Another magazine website. The second journey features in this show at Transition and takes her to the Deep South to follow the plot and locations of Carson McCullers' 1940 novel The Night is a Lonely Hunter.<br>The story centres on the experiences of a deaf man, John Singer, and the people he meets in a 1930s mill town and was the first in a string of works by McCullers to give voice to the rejected, forgotten, mistreated and oppressed.</p>

<p>On discussing ‘Carnal Knowledge,’  a series of previously of unexhibited photographs, Marder says: “I used to have anxiety about my pictures exposing things too private, but the real intimacies are censored out. I still get pangs of self-consciousness, but it’s too late for regret. What was I thinking when I made the pictures? This is in no particular order: fate, kink, performance, a secret, nostalgia, sensual memory, voyeurism, nighttime settings, barren rooms, stark lighting, romantic trysts, foreign environments, intimacy, lack of intimacy, connection, lack of connection, self-reflection, lack of self-reflection, awkwardness, isolation, random, purpose, shadow, vulnerability, immaturity, innocence, amorous bodies, ambiguity, cocoons of emotion, modernist architecture, transience, lurid smells, a patient’s sickbed, love, eroticism, clarity, blushing, bruised, family, boyfriends, conflict, loyalty, disapproval, neuroticism, narcissism, truculence, numbness, sexual discomfort, subconscious, and the past.

<p>ROBERT GUMPERT - INSIDE SAN FRANCISCO'S JAILS</p>

<p>Robert Gumpert has been documenting the criminal justice system in San Francisco since 1994.<br>
Gumpert’s project began with an idea to photograph a homicide detective, but quickly expanded to cover numerous other aspects of the criminal justice system. After he exhibited the work in San Francisco in 2000, he thought that was the end of it, until he received a call from the sheriff’s office. California’s oldest jail was about to close, and for Gumpert, whose photographic roots were planted in the social activism of the 70s, this was a piece of history he felt compelled to document.</p>

<p>Ron Galella is an American photographer, known as a pioneer paparazzo. Dubbed "Paparazzo Extraordinaire" by Newsweek and "the Godfather of the U.S. paparazzi culture" by Time Magazine and Vanity Fair, he is regarded as the most controversial celebrity photographer in the world.</p>

<p>Galella's photographs can be seen in hundreds of publications including Time, Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, Vanity Fair, People, Rolling Stone, The New Yorker, the New York Times and Life. He is widely-known for his obsessive treatment of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and the subsequent legal battles associated with it. The New York Post called them "the most co-dependent celeb-paparazzi relationships ever." In the famous 1972 free-speech trial "Galella v. Onassis", she obtained a restraining order to keep Galella 150 feet away from her and her children.</p>

<p>Galella is the subject of a 2010 documentary film directed by Leon Gast entitled Smash His Camera.</p>

<p>LEONIE HAMPTON - IN THE SHADOWS OF THINGS</p>

<p>In the shadow of things, gathers intimate shots taken inside the household. This time around though, the family unit portrayed is that of the author herself.</p>

<p>Piles, almost layers of things, objects are the manifest and intrusive trace of the presence of her mother’s Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. The illness pushes her to accumulate, tidy up and destroy what she had just organised. A tacit agreement bonds the entire family – Leonie, her brothers, her partner and her mother’s husband – in the sincere and loving effort to assist healing, with the awareness that the eccentric relationship the mother has established with the family, and with the rest of the world, is loaded with awkward and pathological aspects, but that are also tender, funny and in the end, full of love.</p>

<p>For some years Leonie, established photographer, decided to document the different moments of this delicate family relation. A house full of unusable rooms, lives marked by incomprehensible rituals, loud laughters and desperate crying. Leonie does not want to or can afford to be a silent witness: she herself is part of these images that portray affection, warmth, surreal atmospheres hovering between fable and nightmare.</p>

<p>Featuring 31,035 slides shown simultaneously on multiple projectors, ‘Reykjavik Slides’ was inspired by the distinctive character of Icelandic architecture and documents every building in the capital.

<p>Madoz combines daily objects in different ways and takes photographs of this creations, without manipulating the photographs afterwards. This way he creates images that are placed outside their original context and create a new reality together. His photographs are not only taken to be seen, they are made to think about, reflect on and therefore, in all ways, to be contemplated. That is exactly why his pictures are so extraordinary; his visual paradoxes need our reasoning, our consideration; they are created to be completed and accomplished in our thoughts.</p>

<p>His work has been the object of many exhibitions and publications, all over the World. It is part of several international collections, for example the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid; Museo Marugame, Hirai, Japan en Museo de Bellas Artes de Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>YOSSI BREGER</p>

<p>The exhibition presents 159 photos, all new, in various formats, taken since 2007 in various places around the world, Tel Aviv, Berlin, Cologne, Havana, Paris, Brussels, Rome, Beijing, Stockholm—in the course of daily life. <br>The photos of landscapes, buildings, spaces, objects, people tell a story of being in front of a thing, the fundamental things that form the infrastructure of human environment.
They are precise and thoughtful, articulated in pictorial, emotional and classical formal language; their accumulation creates a general conceptual model of a life story and a world, time–space relations constructed by light and revealing a personal and sensual touch with elements of nature and culture</p>

<p>DAVID LACHAPELLE - EARTH LAUGHS IN FLOWERS</p>

<p>The series Earth Laughs in Flowers, which was created this year, refers to art-historical visual traditions but never loses sight of LaChapelle’s own artistic language.<br>
The large-format still lifes in this series, with titles such as The Lovers, Concerning the Soul, Risk or America, seamlessly take up the principle of exaggeration that characterized the portraits of celebrities like Madonna, Pamela Anderson, Michael Jackson, Björk or David Bowie through which LaChapelle himself has become famous since the 1990s. The portraits always contained art-historical references, along with a fear of emptiness, a love of bad taste, an ugly beauty, but David LaChapelle’s recent works now show an explicit compositional affinity to Baroque floral still lifes. Plants, fruits and objects, in place of human bodies, now bear witness to human pride, to the finiteness of life with its obsessions and compulsions, to pleasure and suffering.</p>

<p>DAVID MALJKOVIC - RECALLING FRAMES</p>

<p>David Maljkovic's latest works, Recalling Frames, are photomontages that interweave still images from Orson Welles' film The Trial, shot in Zagreb in 1962, with the artist's own contemporary photographs of the filming locations. Welles' haunting exploration of the terror of faceless bureaucracy was set against the city's Cold War-era Modernist buildings, to which Maljkovic returned to carefully photograph the sites from the same dramatic angles shown in the film. Spliced together from black-and-white negative prints, the resulting unique prints conflate five decades of aesthetic and ideological change.</p>

“There are so many photos of me, taken by other people, that aesthetically I have no control over. Documenting myself allows me to reflect on the day, on the feelings I am having at that second.

<p>People in Trouble Laughing Pushed to the Ground continues Broomberg &amp; Chanarin's ongoing exploration of the limits and possibilities of photography in a historical moment when both ubiquity and technology have rendered the production and use of documentary images intensely problematic, a vector of enquiry pursued and manifest in their earlier, seminal series; The Red House, The Day Nobody Died and American Landscapes.</p>

<p>The new work is the result of an engagement by the artists with Belfast Exposed, a photographic archive founded in 1983. The archive houses images taken by both professional photo-journalists and 'civilian' photographers. Accordingly the archive spans the political, the social and the private, the didactic and the playful.</p>

<p>KARLHEINZ WEINBERGER - INTIMATE STRANGER</p>

<p>The first institutional exhibition of vintage prints by the late Karlheinz Weinberger (1921-2006). An unsung pioneer of vernacular photography since the Fifties, Weinberger captured a young generation of rebels, who were greatly influenced by American culture.<br>
In 1958, Weinberger met members of a small band of teenagers and began photographing them both at his home, as well as at the public parks and fairgrounds where the group gathered. In post-war Switzerland, these self-named “rebels” (referred to by the Swiss as “Halbstark” or “half strong”) were comprised of working class boys and girls dissatisfied by the conservative climate of the day. They adopted a powerful gang identity expressed in their self styled and homemade clothing--embellished jeans, motorcycle jackets, enlarged belt buckles, which referenced and emulated American icons Marlon Brando (in The Wild One), James Dean (in Rebel Without a Cause), Elvis Presley (in the film and album Jailhouse Rock).</p>

<p>MARK SELIGER - LISTEN</p>

<p>The exhibition includes 30 large-scale platinum palladium prints depicting nudes, still lifes, portraits, and New York cityscapes. Along with the exhibition, Seliger released his new book with the same title, Listen (Rizzoli New York, 2010), featuring 90 tritone photographs and an interview with the artist by leading American magazine designer Fred Woodward. Many of the photographs are on exhibition for the first time.</p>

<p>Mark Seliger: Listen is in a sense a memento mori, a tribute to his late father. It follows in the tradition of photographers and painters such as Weston, Stieglitz, and Cézanne who, at a certain age, focus on elegiac studies of the nude, the landscape, and the still life. The pictures are Seliger’s meditations through slow looking. These photographs speak to us metaphorically of the eternal themes of love and death. They pay homage to Seliger’s forebears Brandt, Kertesz, Hosoe, and Penn.</p>

<p>Originally published in 1956, the book has been reprinted by the small British publisher, Dewi Lewis. It focuses on the Left Bank of Paris at the time when the area was a centre of creative ferment and the home of the artists, writers and aesthetes who would determine the cultural agenda of a generation. With its unconventional, gritty, snapshot-like technique the work was widely acclaimed as expanding the boundaries of documentary photography.<br>
Born 1925, in Amsterdam, Ed van der Elsken is recognised as one of the great photographers of the 20th century. During his lifetime he published over 20 books. In recent years his work has been exhibited widely throughout the world.</p>

<p>CINDY SHERMAN</p>

<p>For this series Sherman has assembled a cast of uniquely individual characters on large photographic murals, marking a departure within Cindy Sherman’s artistic practice from the format of the framed photograph.<br>
The various personas animating this new body of work were created as shrines to nondescript, eccentric characters who
might also be seen to denote sentries, guarding the entrance to some fabled land, casting ambiguous and disconcerting
glances at the viewer.</p>

<p>CHRISTOPHER THOMAS - NEW YORK SLEEPS</p>

<p>New York Sleeps is a series of black and white images shot using a custom-made large format camera, Polaroid film and long exposures. The resulting exhibition of 30 large-scale cityscapes, devoid of people, offers an elusive glimpse of 19th century tranquility while hinting at a cryptic, apocalyptic ending.

<p>THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF RAY K. METZKER</p>

<p>Approaching 80 years of age, Ray Metzker is one of the most dedicated, innovative, and influential American photographers of the last half century, his ability to turn ordinary subjects, including the urban experience and nature, into the visual poetry of the finely crafted black-and-white print.<br>
This show will survey the key aspects of Metzker’s long career: Chicago (1956-59); Europe (1960-61); Philadelphia cityscapes (1962-63); double-image “couplets” and multi-image composites (1964-69); optical abstractions (“Pictus Interruptus” series of 1977-80); later Chicago and Philadelphia cityscapes (1981-84); landscapes (1985-95); and his recent city pictures (1996-2009).</p>

<p>ANDY WARHOL - BEHIND THE CAMERA</p>

<p>The exhibition, Andy Warhol: Behind the Camera includes 60 works, It is the first time these photographs have been publicly shown. Prime examples of Warhol’s obsessive camerawork, they illustrate the artist’s largely unknown achievements in photography, which are as distinctive as his celebrated paintings, prints, and films.</p>

<p>The work of some photographers is forever identified with the particular cameras they used; Henri Cartier-Bresson and his state-of-the art Leica come to mind. This is true also of Warhol, who loved certain cameras to the point of obsession. But unlike fine-art photographers who typically master complicated equipment, Warhol invariably opted for devices marketed to the home consumer with as few controls as possible. Whether expensive Japanese miniature cameras or cheap Polaroid models, what mattered for Warhol was the lack of photographic “knowledge” required to operate them.</p>

<p>NAN GOLDIN. BERLIN WORK. PHOTOGRAPHS 1984 TO 2009</p>

<p>The American artist Nan Goldin is a leading exponent of ‘subjective photography’. Her own life forms the focus of her artistic work. Goldin has repeatedly spent extended periods in Berlin since the 1980s. In 1991 she was able to spend an entire year in Berlin as part of the DAAD artist programme. With around 100 photographs, the Berlinische Galerie is presenting a comprehensive insight into her work created in Berlin, whereby it is also drawing on previously unpublished material from the artist’s archive, which has never before been presented.</p>

<p>PENELOPE UMBRICO</p>

<p>Penelope Umbrico offers a radical reinterpretation of everyday consumer and vernacular images. As Umbrico describes, she works “within the virtual world of consumer marketing and social media, traveling through the relentless flow of seductive images, objects, and information that surrounds us, searching for decisive moments—but in these worlds, decisive moments are cultural absurdities.” <br>
Umbrico finds these moments in the printed pages of consumer product mail-order catalogs, travel and leisure brochures, and online sites such as Craigslist, EBay, and Flickr. By identifying and isolating image typologies—candy-colored horizons and sunsets, books used as props—the farcical and surreal nature of the lingua franca of consumerism and recreation is brought to new light.</p>

<p>She  presents a unique and challenging approach to quintessential issues of representation in contemporary culture, including how images 
are used to construct and communicate consumer desire, and whether or not the 
growing volume of images we view online fosters a critical visual literacy. <br> Her first monograph Penelope Umbrico (Photographs) released in June 2011.</p>

<p>KEEGAN GIBBS - OPEN SPACE</p>

<p>The first solo photo exhibition by Keegan Gibbs. Open Space is a collection of images, collages, and installations which are inspired by his life in surfing<br>
Open Space is my expression of the state one falls into while floating weightless off shore, looking out to sea, hoping and waiting for the next set. Troubles are isolated far away on the unreality of land, while you are free in the truest reality of water. It is a timeless unspoilable state that cannot be ruined, not even by the angry local that may be slashing your tires and waxing your windows simply because he doesn’t want to share some waves. To a surfer it's an understandable act of necessary evil to keep an ungoverned subculture in form, and from it breaking into full bore beach-blanket-bingo havoc.</p>

<p>SALLY MANN: THE FLESH AND THE SPIRIT</p>

<p>Sally Mann's most recent work represents an intriguing new direction. She is tackling expansive themes of mortality and vulnerability, while for the first time using herself and her husband as subjects. In addition, she has taken her bold experiments with the medium to new heights, pushing photography to its limits by making painterly and nearly abstract images—many as unique pieces on glass plates. Altogether the exhibition and accompanying catalog will present an unexpected picture of Mann's work, encouraging a fresh perspective on one of today's preeminent photographers and, it is hoped, an opportunity to extend her visibility well beyond the realm of photography. <br> The Book,

<p>LOCALS ONLY - HUGH HOLLAND</p>

<p>Locals only - California Skateboarding: 1975 – 1978 is a new book of color photographs by Hugh Holland that capture the Los Angeles skateboard revolution during the mid-Seventies from an insider’s perspective. <br>Unlike most photographers capturing the craze, Holland’s photographs were never about the sport. Holland shot with old color negative movie film, rendering his images in warm, soft tones that were in complete contrast to the sharp, crisp chromes that the majority of skate photographers were using at the time. Beyond the bodies in motion, Holland captures beautifully intimate portraits of the young boys sitting under the trees waiting their turn, resting by the chain link fence at Kenter or in peaceful contemplation after a long day of riding. Holland primarily shot his subjects in the late afternoon, bathing his models and settings with an effervescent, glistening quality. They are, in essence, photographs of a generation of boys discovering their identity amidst the backdrop of cultural phenomena that shaped a generation.</p>

His work combines voyeuristic and psychological viewpoints in a unique manner. <br>The photographer offers to the beholder an exciting insight into the emotions and experiences of the protagonists of his illustrative worlds. It is predominantly the night shots of glittering metropolises such as New York, Hong Kong, and San Francisco which serve as gigantic backdrops for his photographs. With their impressive skyscrapers, they provide the beholder with a nearly infinite surface for the imagination. Thus, it is only consistent that Drebin gives the viewer a voyeuristic insight into the apartments, where he mystically stages attractive women in a glamorous and sexy manner. <br>In conjunction with the exihibition, Drebin releases his new book "The Morning After," published by teNeues.</p>

The exhibition features Leibovitz’s portraits of well-known figures, including actors such as Jamie Foxx, Daniel Day Lewis, Demi Moore, Scarlett Johansson, Al Pacino, Nicole Kidman and Brad Pitt as well as artists and architects such as Richard Avedon, Brice Marden, Philip Johnson, Chuck Close and Cindy Sherman.</p>

<p>BRUCE WEBER: HAITI / LITTLE HAITI</p>

<p>In 2003, The Miami Herald published a magazine supplement of Bruce Weber's photographs of Miami's Haitian community. The photographs were Weber’s response to an unjust U.S. immigration system in which Haitian men, women and children were detained indefinitely unlike refugees from other countries who were typically released to family or friends while awaiting asylum hearings.<BR>The documentary film, The Agronomist, by Jonathan Demme, had been Weber’s call to arms.  In it, Demme chronicled the life of Haiti’s most famous journalist, Jean Dominique, the founder of Radio Haiti Internationale, and his murder by unknown assailants in 2000.  Incensed by the violence, political strife, and poverty depicted in the film, Weber asked Demme what he could do, and Demme suggested turning his attention to what was happening to Haitians in Miami, where Weber had a home. Compelled to tell the story of the struggle of Haitian immigrants, Weber immersed himself in the Haitian community, which he has continued to chronicle through the present.</p>

<p>Weber chose primarily to work in black-and-white for the project, but switched to color film when photographing Haitian Flag Day celebrations.  Over the years he has built up a large archive of photographs of Haitian celebrations, church congregations, Little Haiti stores and boulevards, as well as portraits of individuals, groups, and families.</p>

<p>4 SALE</p>

<p>4 Sale debuts the culmination of the year
long creative union between Aneta Bartos, Elle Muliarchyk, Yana
Toyber and Martynka Wawrzyniak. The imagery delves into universal
mores and ideals all the while producing beautiful, conceptually strong
and visually stimulating works. 4 Sale captures the essence of the
dynamic nature within this collaboration curated by Anne Huntington.
The works appropriate, suggest and formalize the collaboration within
the full photographic body. <br>Each artist conceptualizes unique realities within her framed vignettes, thus illustrating how each artist proclaims
her unique voice, idea and story.</p>

<p>The process evolves through
openness, risk-taking, exploration and the incorporation of artistic and
cultural influences. The fundamental nature of the works materializes
organic and potentially controversial issues; issues that the artists
keenly acknowledge and own. This acute awareness underscores the
complexity of the project that liberates, provokes and creates a sense of
union between these four talented artists of Eastern European descent.</p>

<p>STEFAN RUIZ - THE FACTORY OF DREAMS</p>

<p>Televisa Studios, in the San Angel neighborhood of Mexico City, is called ‘The Factory of Dreams’ and is best-known for its telenovelas (soap operas). These fantasies of love, wealth and betrayal are one of Mexico’s largest exports. They are popular throughout Latin America but also in Africa, Asia, Europe and the USA. No one produces more telenovelas than Mexico’s Televisa studios. The telenovela and its protagonists are a powerful vehicle through which contemporary Latin American culture and its society can be understood and interpreted.</p>

<p>Stefan first photographed Televisa studios in 2003 for COLORS magazine as their creative director. He returned to the studios after the issue published and continued to work on the project over a period of six years. Stefan's behind-thescenes photographs in ‘The factory of dreams’ reveal this secret world with humor and affection.</p>

<p>DAN HOLDSWORTH - BLACKOUT</p>

<p>Blackout brings together a remarkable new sequence of images taken in Iceland by British photographer Dan Holdsworth. Occupying a space between documentary and the make-believe, Holdsworth’s photographs combine traditional analogue methods with digital processing to transform the elemental terrain of a giant glacier as it melts away. The result is an other-worldly vision of the future. Reproduced at a grand scale, the blue of sky becomes the deep black of space, while the earth appears in negative, beyond imaginable human time and space.</p>

<p>TIM BARBER - UNTITLED PHOTOGRAPHS</p>

<p>In his first major U.S. show titled Untitled Photographs, Barber presents a collection of images spanning his fifteen years behind the lens. Known for elegantly composed observations that locate complex beauty in the seemingly mundane, Barber’s Untitled Photographs offers a selection of over forty of his images. <br>From portraits to landscapes to narrative scenes, Barber approaches all of his subject matter with a palpable delicacy. Expanding on amateur aesthetics, these images can feel as much like spontaneous documentation of the artist’s adventures as careful compositions. The line between autobiography and fiction is as ethereal as the overall tone of the work. In the case of Barber’s photography, ambiguity is seductive, and the lure of fantasy eclipses the security of literality.</p>

<p>WOMEN ARE BEAUTIFUL</p>

<p>Often regarded as the founder of ‘street photography’, the American Garry Winogrand took countless photographs of women in New York between 1960 and 1975. A final collection of 85 photos was put together by John Szarkowski, the legendary curator of the Museum of Modern Art, for a work published in 1975 under the title ‘WOMEN ARE BEAUTIFUL’. For the most part taken on the street, Winogrand’s snapshots document the life of young and emancipated women of the period in a unique way. <br>The photographer has created valuable documents illustrating the changes in women’s understanding of their own role – with self-confident female figures either enjoying themselves at parties or making their voices heard at political demonstrations. As a result of the wide time span, the viewer is able to experience the development of fashion and pop culture over two of the most lively decades of the past century. </p>

<p>STEPHEN SHORE - UNCOMMON PLACES</p>

<p>Stephen Shore's first solo show in Berlin for over 15 years. The exhibition will feature 80 previously unseen works from the series Uncommon Places, in addition to a number of pages from his seminal Road Trip Journal.<br>
Stephen Shore embarked on his first road trip in the summer of 1972 which resulted in the series American Surfaces. With a Rollei 35 mm camera, the forerunner of the point-and-shoot, Shore was able to immediately capture the people, places and objects he encountered, producing a series of consciously casual and intimate snapshots.</p>

<p>While Shore continued to document his travels, he wanted to explore a greater visual intentionality and, therefore, began his next series of work in 1973 entitled Uncommon Places. Here the artist focuses on the minutiae of modern life in America, capturing anonymous intersections, residential architecture, uniform drive-by diners, generic motel rooms and monotonous gas stations, all of which were shot using colour film and a view camera, a combination that had rarely been put to use in recording America’s social landscape.</p>

<p>NEW PHOTOGRAPHY 2010</p>

<p>New Photography 2010 presents four artists, Roe Ethridge, Elad Lassry, Alex Prager, and Amanda Ross-Ho, whose photographs mine the inexhaustible reservoir of images found in print media and cinema. Ethridge takes his pictures in “editorial mode,” directly borrowing from commercial images already in circulation, including outtakes from his own illustrational magazine work. Lassry defines his practice as one consumed with pictures, meaning with generic images lifted from consumer society, such as Hollywood publicity stills and design illustrations.<br>Ross-Ho’s hand-drilled sheetrock panels lined up with found pictures and mural-scale images of studio residues renegotiate the various stages of the creative process. Prager takes her cues from pulp fiction and the fashion images of Guy Bourdin to construct filmic narratives starring women disguised under synthetic wigs, dramatic makeup, and retro polyester attire.</p>

<p>TARYN SIMON - CONTRABAND</p>

<p>Contraband is Taryn Simon’s new series of portraits depicting various items confiscated at Terminal 4 at JFK Airport.  It provides an in-depth and curious look at what happens when one culture encounters another. <br> Simon spent five mostly sleepless days at the airport, photographing over 1,000 contraband objects ranging from the relatively unsurprising (counterfeit designer bags, bongs) to the  flat-out strange (cow-dung toothpaste, insect larvae). While many of the photographs’ subjects are shocking, they open a discussion about the  material values of different cultures and what happens when one set of cultural beliefs is dominated by another. Though the series portrays contrasting cultural values, the repetition of some items demonstrates the universality of certain societal norms, such as the mass-market appeal of cheap, knockoff material goods.</p>

<p>NOT IN FASHION - FASHION AND PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE 90'S</p>

<p>Not In Fashion - Fashion and Photography in the 90s, focuses in particular on presenting wide-ranging historical documentation on the fashion scene of the 1990s, in this way offering a strong impression of the creative output of the period.<br> The exhibits will include reproductions of famous photo spreads and innovative ad campaigns, devised among others by Jürgen Teller, Helmut Lang, Inez van Lamsweerde and Yohji Yamamoto.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, the fashion scene fundamentally reinvented specifically the medium of photography. That decade gave rise to a new generation for whom personal identity, individualism and a self-defined style were of crucial importance. Back then, the joie de vivre of the generation of 20-30 year-old creative minds thrived on music, subculture, intimacy and fashion.<br> A new notion of corporeality was being celebrated in the major capitals of the world, such as London, New York, Tokyo, Berlin and Paris. The protagonists of this era sought to distinguish themselves from the established art and fashion scenes, and develop an alternative, lived counter-culture. They felt that the overly artificial images of prêt-à-porter, haute couture and glossy fashion magazines needed to be overcome and replaced with “real life” pictures instead Youth-Culture. They thus collectively dismissed the notion of the beautiful, and tried to elide gender differences and other social conventions.</p>

<p>TALES OF RESISTANCE AND CHANGE</p>

<p>The exhibition "Tales of Resistance and Change. Artists from Argentina” presents works by twelve contemporary Argentine artists and artist groups that conceive their socio-political environments as a field for reflection and action. Starting from a diversity of contexts, their works are to be understood as processes of research in which the present, traditions and recent history are combined. The geopolitical complexity of the country influences these productions in which urban and rural rhythms, immigrant and native heritage, transformations and political conflicts are perceived.<br>
“After the economic crisis of 2001–the curator, Rodrigo Alonso, points out–Argentine artists started to question and examine their reality reactivating critical practices that had been inactive during the previous neoliberal period. Some of them interacted with the new political militancy, others approached several communities and others created social inclusion projects with sectors of the population that had been particularly affected by the financial conflict”.</p>

Spending a full year on the road, the couple drove their 18-wheeler over one hundred thousand miles and spent over two thousand hours delivering loads.

<p>Ed Ruscha, Apartments, Parking Lots, Palm Trees and Others: Films, Photographs and Drawings from 1961 to 1975 is the full title of Ruscha's new exhibition of works. Inspired by the American photography of the nineteen-forties and -fifties, Ruscha broke with the traditions of the genre and simultaneously distanced himself from the subjectivist, analytical photo-books of such author-photographers as Robert Frank and Walker Evans. <br>Coming to the fore here, instead of pictorial sequences ordered according to formal and contentual critiera, was a serial arrangement in which the disregard of classical conventions of photography, namely the requirements of perspective and composition, became a characteristic of his photographic aesthetic.</p>

<p>A full review of her work since her death last year, through 120 images and the documentary film In the Street Helen Levitt is one of the great North American photographers of the second half of the 20th century. Her work is notable for her unique outlook and her documentary style, focusing on urban life, mainly in the street of New York. Her images capture tiny moments of daily life, apparently banal instants yet which have great metaphoric meaning for the social conditions of our time.</p>

<p>This exhibition, produced by the ICO Foundation, is the first anthology organised since her death in 2009 aged 96. It presents close to 120 images taken between 1936 and the 1990s, and the documentary In the Street, a precursor to independent American film which she made with the writer James Agee and the painter Janice Loeb in 1945. The exhibition underlines how Levitt’s work set out the aesthetics of instantaneity in street photography, with her ability to suspend movement, to capture tiny moments, to break the flow of reality with endless visual potential.</p>

<p>Exhibition runs through to August 29th, 2010.</p>

<p>ALL MY LOVIN'</p>

<p>All My Lovin' is a group exhibition with works by Elinor Carucci, Lydia Panas, Phillip Toledano and Edith Maybin.
The exhibition shows photographic works concerned exclusively with "You and I". <br>It is an exhibition about love, loving and being loved; about loved ones at home, by our side, or separated from us, those with whom we feel the deepest bonds of the soul, but with whom our everyday relations are often filled with conflict, so that we experience alternating emotional security and insecurity. <br>All my lovin' speaks of human relationships in powerful and moving individual images and picture series. We see couples young and old, fathers, mothers, parents with their children, happy and unhappy people, strangers who approach strangers, and others who emerge from the prison of restricted thinking in order to show spontaneous sympathy and experience love.</p>

<p>ELLEN STAGG - MELTING FLESH</p>

<p>Ellen Stagg shares her multi-exposed mix of bodies at Fuse Gallery.
A phantasmagoric mix of bodies, light, sex, and ether reside in Ellen Stagg’s multi-exposed photographs. Stagg embraces the unexpected and opts for a toy Holga camera using film and Polaroid over the manufactured guise of digital. The multiple exposures cause the women's nude bodies to melt into one another as well as their surroundings.<br>The fluid nature of the images –
produced through the manipulation of light leaks, finger prints and film type – offers the viewer a surreal visual that is simultaneously in flux and static.<br>Each piece is presented in a unique steel

<p>MICHAEL SCHMIDT - GREY AS COLOUR</p>

<p>Michael Schmidt takes only black-and-white photographs since, in his view, this neutralises our colourful world reducing it to a wide spectrum of greys. therefore, schmidt could be considered a photographer of greys rather than black-and-white: 'grey is my colour. there are thousands of grey gradations. black and white are always the darkest and the lightest grey'.<br> His images thereby lack any kind of superficiality; they avoid any sort of event and are far removed from the photographic concept of the 'decisive moment'. up until the 1990s, Schmidt concentrated almost exclusively on his home town berlin.</p>

<p>THE BURIAL OF HAILE SELASSIE</p>

<p>The twenty-one photographs in this exhibition document a remarkable event in recent Ethiopian history, one that provoked fresh debate about both Haile Selassie and Ethiopia’s troubled political history. The photographs shown here explore the tensions between royal, state and religious hierarchies surrounding the ceremony, as well as more personal expressions of loyalty by some of the participants.</p>

<p>Haile Selassie was crowned Emperor of Abyssinia in 1930, but shortly afterwards fled into exile when Mussolini invaded the country in 1935. Despite his appeal to the League of Nations for intervention, the European powers wished to avoid conflict with Italy. Haile Selassie returned triumphantly in 1941 after a military campaign ousted the Italian forces, and the country was renamed Ethiopia.</p>

“I met Amber when she was 15. She came to my studio for a casting. She was quiet and feisty at the same time, and kind of bratty and fascinating. I loved her slow-paced, drawn out Kentucky sentences, so perfectly out of place in East London. And I really liked how she didn’t seem to give a shit.

<p>ZED NELSON - LOVE ME</p>

Over a period of five years Zed Nelson visited seventeen countries across five continents, reflecting on a world we have created in which there are enormous social, psychological and economic rewards and penalties attached to the way we look.</p>

During his evening perambulations the photographer captured trees and houses, mountains and streets, fields and sidewalks between dusk and approaching dark.

<p>ELLIOTT ERWITT - PARIS</p>

<p>Elliott Erwitt born in Paris in 1928 to Russian parents, Erwitt spent his childhood in Milan, then emigrated to the US, via France, with his family in 1939. As a teenager living in Hollywood, he developed an interest in photography and worked in a commercial darkroom before experimenting with photography at Los Angeles City College. In 1948 he moved to New York and exchanged janitorial work for film classes at the New School for Social Research.<br>
Erwitt traveled in France and Italy in 1949 with his trusty Rolleiflex camera. In 1951 he was drafted for military service and undertook various photographic duties while serving in a unit of the Army Signal Corps in Germany and France.<br>
While in New York, Erwitt met Edward Steichen, Robert Capa and Roy Stryker, the former head of the Farm Security Administration. Stryker initially hired Erwitt to work for the Standard Oil Company, where he was building up a photographic library for the company, and subsequently commissioned him to undertake a project documenting the city of Pittsburgh.</p>

With great capacity of penetration, his works explore the most striking contradictions of African societies, together with certain peripheral aspects which are nonetheless dense in meaning.<br>For the production of his Nollywood series, with its large size pictures, the artist frequented in 2008 and 2009 the sets of the Nigerian film industry. With an eye that is at once detached from but in dialogue with the subjects of his portraits - with whom he always builds up relationships of mutual awareness - Hugo is fascinated by the borderline situations he identifies on his trips throughout Africa.</p>

<p>Gagosian Gallery is pleased to present "Boarding House," a new series of photographs by Roger Ballen taken between 2004 and 2008. The Boarding House is a three-story warehouse hidden among the gold mines of Johannesburg and inhabited by disenfranchised, impoverished families, fugitives and witch doctors. <br>Lacking walls, many rooms are separated only by rugs, blankets, and metal sheets. In his visually complex tableaux, Ballen forgoes a strictly documentary approach and casts further doubt on their veracity, intervening to alter each room, and collaborating directly with the subject to create the sculptures and drawings that appear in the photographs .</p>

<p>Exhibition runs though to December 23rd, 2009</p>

<p>OIL</p>

<p>Burtynsky’s obsession with oil began in 1997, when he identified oil as a key building block of the last century—politically, economically and socially—on a global scale. He has tracked this controversial, valuable and increasingly scarce resource from extraction to production to consumption. The far reaching scope of the project has taken him from oil fields to expressways, from Western Canada to Los Angeles to the Middle East.</p>

<p>SHOWSTUDIO</p>

<p>Our experience of fashion is changing. In these times of instant, digitally-fuelled information, the fashion image is no longer confined to the static world of the printed photograph. Today we are confronted with a dramatic new fashion universe, where photography, film, performance, music, art and technology combine to create an infinitely richer landscape.</p>

<p>Since launching nine years ago, Nick Knight's fashion website SHOWstudio.com has pioneered the most imaginative and exciting forms of fashion for the Internet. These have both informed and inspired the current fashion revolution.

<p>TOUT VA DISPARAITRE</p>

<p>Hellen van Meene's intimate portraits of the awkward drama of adolescence take the conflicted emotions of her teenage subjects and infuse them with a quiet melancholy. She has staged her models in moody rooms of rich color, often using natural light from a nearby window, and dressed them in 19th century draped gowns of silk and lace. The resulting pictures feel like small angst-filled performances, or odd dress up games, where the girls adopt blank stares and mannequin-like poses that only partially conceal their inner lives.</p>

The M9 is the upgrade to the M8, which turned one of their most iconic cameras into a digital one. The X1 will be priced lower and unites lots of features in compact format.

<p>SEVEN STORIES</p>

<p>After completing The Americans in 1958, Robert Frank put aside the single image and concentrated throughout the 1960s on film-making. He only returned to still-photographs in the 1970s, using a Polaroid camera with black-and-white positive/negative film. He frequently layered the images with text, which he inscribed by hand onto the Polaroid negative. <br>In recent years Robert Frank has worked almost exclusively with Polaroids, exploring the collage and assemblage possibilities of the instant photograph. Seven Stories brings together sequences of single images Frank has been compiling to create books of new work.</p>

<p>SUMO</p>

<p>The Helmut Newton Foundation presents what might just be the most spectacular and expensive photography book project ever. Ten years ago, publisher Benedikt Taschen persuaded Helmut Newton to agree to produce a gigantic book with a print run of 10,000 copies, all signed by the photographer. Accompanied by a custom-made book holder by Philippe Starck, the book found its way into the homes of well-heeled buyers. Now, for the first time, its 394 photographs will go on display to mark the 10th anniversary of a photography publication that today is a much sought-after collector’s item.</p>

<p>This year marks the 40th Anniversary of Les Rencontres d’Arles festival of photography, for four decades, this festival has helped to define the best and brightest in photography — and it has generated quite a bit of controversy along the way, often featuring the work of iconoclasts, renegades, and troublemakers, some of whom are regarded as superstars today. So, there is a good deal of heightened anticipation about what we will discover from this year's guest curator, New York photo legend Nan Goldin. Goldin has invited the following photographers as guest exhibitors : David Armstrong, Marina Berio, Jean-Christian Bourcart , Antoine D’Agata , JH Engström, Christine Fenzl, Leigh Ledare, Boris Mikhailov, Anders Petersen, Jack Pierson, Lisa Ross, Annelies Strba.</p>

<p>VOIES OFF</p>

<p>Since 1996, the Voies Off festival has been advocating for the role of photography in contemporary art and other various creative practices, providing them with an international stage during the Rencontres d’Arles. As an alternative to the program of the Rencontres, Voies Off  invites a general audience to discover the photographic works by young authors. This year, the panel of jurors selected over 60 artists from all horizons among 950 candidates. They will compete for the 2009 Voies Off Prize. Their works will be shown during night projections every night under the starry sky of the courtyard of the Archbishop’s Palace. These night showings are in fact the heart of the Voies Off festival. Other events include daily portfolio reviews, professional “mornings,” and several thematic exhibitions.</p>

<p>United Visual Artists (UVA), established in 2003 by Chris Bird, Matt Clark and Ash Nehru, are a London-based art and design practice creating large-scale light-based installations. UVA creates more than mere spectacle, their work is about people. Their work aims to create a powerful social experience, turning the audience into active participants. The relationship between space, the performer and the audience is at the very heart of United Visual Artists’ practice.  Having worked at the interface between, design and art, UVA present their premiere exhibition of still images at The Smithfield Gallery, London, distilling their live creations into a single moment. These images continue their investigation into the emotional effects of light within a diversity of landscapes and environments.  Deus is a photographic exploration of the seductive quality of artificial light in the natural world. This body of work grew from an extended study of form and experiments on how a powerfully illuminated presence affects the surrounding environment.</p>

<p>WOMEN ARE BEAUTIFUL</p>

<p>The work of Garry Winogrand (1928-84) helped define a quintessential “American” photography in the late twentieth century. Winogrand’s photographs of street life, the suburbs, and the fractured, postwar, new consumer culture that emerged in the 1950s, remind us how the every day is loaded with anonymous joy and pathos and how each moment in life is filled with happenstance and the unexpected. Women Are Beautiful is a time capsule of the Pop and Mod 1960s. These photographs attest to the ever-changing nature of fashion and the representation of female beauty. “Street” photographs, they raise tricky issues like the “male gaze” and voyeurism, and how they relate to the paparazzi-style reportage that is a mainstay of our contemporary culture</p>

<p>NATURE NATION</p>

<p>The Nature Nation exhibition is based on diverse aspects of distinctions, positions, beliefs, ideologies, and social, political and economic points of departure that explore the complex encounter between man and the environment and between man and nature. The exhibition is not based on a romantic reading that interprets nature and its expanses as pre-existent to man’s shaping intervention. Rather, it proposes a critical reading, which presumes that the encounter between them is a mirror for broader phenomena. This mirror reflects the crisis in the relations between man and nature, which finds expression in neglect, conquest and deterioration.</p>

<p>Following a successful kick off in New York and subsequent stops in Houston, Indianapolis, Greensboro, and Baltimore, Dawoud Bey's traveling exhibition Class Pictures, featuring striking, large-scale color portraits of students at high schools across the United States is now showing at the Milwaukee Art Museum. For the past fifteen years, Bey has been photographing teenagers from a wide economic, social, and ethnic spectrum, and—intensely attentive to their poses and gestures—has created a highly diverse generational portrait that challenges stereotypes of teenagers.

<p>THE AMERICANS</p>

<p>Robert Frank's The Americans (first published in France in 1958 and in the United States in 1959) is widely celebrated as the most important photography book to appear since World War II. Featuring 83 photographs made largely in 1955 and 1956 while Frank traveled the United States, the project looked beneath the surface of American life to reveal a profound sense of alienation, angst, and loneliness.</p>

<p>Frank's prescient photographs redefined the icons of America, demonstrating that cars, jukeboxes, gas stations, diners, and even the road itself were telling symbols of contemporary life. Frank's style — distinguished by seemingly loose, casual compositions, often with rough, blurred, out-of-focus foregrounds and tilted horizons — was just as controversial and influential as his subject matter. The exhibition celebrates the 50th anniversary of the publication by presenting all 83 photographs in the order established by the book, accompanied by a detailed examination of the project, its relationship to Frank's earlier work, and its impact on his later art.</p>

<p>AVEDON</p>

<p>Richard Avedon (1923–2004) revolutionized fashion photography starting in the post-World War II era and redefined the role of the fashion photographer. Anticipating many of the cultural cross-fertilizations that have occurred between high art, commercial art, fashion, advertising, and pop culture in the last twenty years, he created spirited, imaginative photographs that showed fashion and the modern woman in a new light. He shook up the chilly, static formulas of the fashion photograph and by 1950 was the most imitated American editorial photographer. Injecting a forthright, American energy into a business that had been dominated by Europeans, Avedon's stylistic innovations continue to influence photographers around the world.</p>

<p>This exhibition will be the most comprehensive exploration to date of Avedon's fashion photography during his long career at Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, The New Yorker, and beyond. Working closely with The Richard Avedon Foundation, ICP curator Carol Squiers and guest curator Vince Aletti will present new scholarship on the evolution and extraordinary, ongoing impact of his work. The exhibition will feature more than 200 works by Richard Avedon, spanning his entire career, and will include vintage prints, contact sheets, magazine layouts, and archival material.</p>

<p>UNSEEN</p>

<p>The exhibition of 32 previously unseen images from the Guy Bourdin archive, includes images from his commercial work for French Vogue and Charles Jourdan shoes. Guy Bourdin launched his career with fashion assignments for Vogue, Paris which employed colour photography to its maximum effect, creating dramatic accents with saturated colour and texture.</p>

<p>While on the one hand employing formal elements of composition, Guy Bourdin sought to transcend the reality of the photographic medium with surreal twists to the apparent subject of his images and his unconventional manipulation of the picture plane. The art of Guy Bourdin communicates an entirely different reality, challenging our perception and provoking our senses with his layered narratives. Clever juxtapositions of objects and body parts contribute to the formal abstraction of the image while at the same time revealing potent sensual details. The surrealist quality of the images is heightened by their unique sense of location—often views in undistinguished bedrooms, the beach, to the side of a road. The unusual dramas that unfold in these seemingly everyday scenes and ordinary encounters pique our subconscious and invite our imagination.</p>

<p>31 YEARS</p>

<p>The Michael Hoppen Gallery is delighted to announce 31 Years; an exhibition of work by Boris Savelev, one of Russia’s most important and renowned photographers. It will be the first time his work will be shown in the UK. 31 Years is a series of photographs created by Savelev from 1976 to 2006. It documents not only his changing sensibilities and aesthetic concerns; light and form, flashes of colour, moments created by the interaction of individuals within their urban landscape, but also his experimentation with both kallitype layered over silver gelatin and meticulously multi layered pigment prints, which feed and inform the resulting images.</p>

<p>REVELATIONS IN THE DARK</p>

<p>Italian artist Roberto Saletti conjures images from a time and space less defined and more like enigmatic memories with his "partial revelation" darkroom techniques.
Saletti's photographic explorations go beyond what is captured through his camera lens and begins with the creative work in the darkroom. Stretching the nature of the photographic image, Saletti uses a process of painting developing solution onto the white photograph paper with a rag after exposing the image onto the paper. This technique pushes his original image and creates greater freedom and expressiveness in Saletti's photographic artwork. Saletti commented, "I have learned to make optimal photos from a technical point of view; then I have realized I was being bored and I pushed to search for greater freedom."</p>

<p>DOLL FACE</p>

<p>Miles Aldridge’s images depict a stupendously glossy and magnetically vibrant world with ultra slick, hyper-lit models and signature acid tones. Standing out among contemporary fashion and figurative photography for its luminous composition and for the mysterious situations he has created, these aspects of his practice both derive and simultaneously depart from the work of artists which Hamiltons has represented over the decades, including Horst, Penn and Avedon. Cinematic expression marks Aldridge’s work and it is not surprising therefore that his dreamlike, erotic style has drawn comparisons with the work of Bergman, Dali, David Lynch, Hitchcock and Godard amongst others.</p>

<p>ONCE UPON A LIE</p>

<p>Meryl Donoghue’s current work is comprised of a collection of large-scale gyclee prints, depicting a series of strikingly lit human/animal hybrids arranged in black space. These images, born from pencil drawings, are digital creations. Transferred from page to screen, constructed from photography and then manipulated. The final images possess a sense of magical reality, underpinned by the suggestion of something more sinister and foreboding.</p>

<p>The new work in ‘Once Upon A lie…’ is inspired by stories that the artist has heard and events in her life that hold sway over her. It is a portrayal of desperate circumstances with unsettling and incalculable outcomes and in part pays homage to past writers, poets and musicians whose work has fuelled her imagination and inspired invention.</p>

<p>Donoghue’s work explores a number of themes such as loneliness, abandonment, loss and punishment.</p>

<p>The Photographic Object will examine photography as an object in its own right and on its own terms. The advent of digital photography and the current saturation of imagery, through print, mobile phones and the internet, has resulted in a renewed interest in the physical and tactile quality of the photograph.</p>

<p>This exhibition will bring together a diversity of approaches to the photograph as ‘object’, such as overlaying, stitching, cutting, piercing, punching or moulding the works. The works in the exhibition will explore the material potential of the photographic form that lies somewhere between two and three dimensions.

<p>CAMERA TRUCK</p>

<p>Camera truck is the worlds largest travelling camera, it takes pictures about 3000 times larger than 35mm negative. The camera truck works in exactly the same way as a pinhole camera.  Light enters a sealed chamber through a tiny opening, and falls onto the opposite wall inside. Here it produces an inverted image of the world outside. <BR>
The first pinhole photograph was taken by Scottish scientist Sir David Brewster but the pinhole effect was observed by the Chinese philospher Mo Ti in 5 BC and also Aristotle in 4 BC.  The cameratruck uses this same principle only amplified thousands of times and with a lens added for sharper detail in the final shots. The cargo box of the truck becomes a sealed chamber, and the aperture is a small hole in one side.  As light enters the truck, it falls onto giant sheets of photographic paper pinned to the opposite wall. This is how Camera truck creates giant negatives, almost three metres wide.</p>

<p>THE WINNER IS...</p>

<p>Paul Graham has been awarded the 2009 Deutsche Börse Photography Prize.  At a special ceremony on Wednesday 25 March 2009, Jefferson Hack, co-founder of Dazed &amp; Confused, presented the £30,000 award.</p>

<p>The Prize is awarded to an international photographer for their significant contribution to the medium of photography through either an exhibition or publication, in Europe between1 October 2007 and 30 September 2008. Paul Graham won for his publication a shimmer of possibility (steidlMACK, October 2007).</p>

<p>A shimmer of possibility comprises twelve individual volumes of photographic short stories of life in contemporary America. Graham infuses lyricism into the most mundane of everyday human activities – fetching mail or lighting a cigarette – and creates quiet photographic moments, ‘filmic haikus’, which suggest and hint at a narrative but ultimately remain open-ended. At once poetic and political, his photographs manage to draw out something truly profound from the almost-nothingness of everyday life.</p>

<p>An exclusive portfolio of Paul Grahams work can be seen in the forthcoming Spring/Summer issue of Exit publishing April 2009</p>

<p>This exhibition runs until the 12th of April, 2009</p>

<p>IN YOUR PLACE</p>

<p>The Selby is in your Place by Todd Selby started in June 2008 with this simple premise: exploring the ways one's personal space reflects one's personality, documenting creative people in their creative environment.</p>

<p>Todd set out to photograph and document his friends in their respective environment and began posting daily the recording of these sessions on a website, aptly named The Selby . Friends were soon followed by friends of friends —authors, actors, curators, directors, painters, performers and designers, filmed and photographed in their odd, fun, quirky, bohemian, clean, colorful, messy, irreverent, intimate, and always surprising spaces. By mid-summer, the site was garnering up to 30,000 hits a day, its subjects spanning New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Mexico, London and Paris. Now showing at Colette until May 2nd, 2009</p>

Comprised of over 150 images, it presents an up-to-date view, as seen by 75 photographers whose images have made and continue to define the region a place for "discoverers, dreamers, and drifters" featuring the work of approximately seventy photographers, including Robert Adams, John Baldessari, Dorothea Lange, Timothy O'Sullivan, Cindy Sherman, Joel Sternfeld, Edward Weston, and Carleton E.

<p>IN HIGH FASHION</p>

<p>An exhibition of 175 works by Edward Steichen drawn largely from the Condé Nast archives, this is the first presentation to give serious consideration to the full range of Steichen's fashion images. <br>
Steichen's approach to fashion photography was formative and over the course of his career he changed public perceptions of the American woman. An architect of American Modernism and a Pictorialist, Steichen exhibited his fashion images alongside his art photographs. Steichen's crisp, detailed, high-key style revolutionized fashion photography, and his influence is felt in the field to this day—Richard Avedon, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Bruce Weber are among his stylistic successors.

<p>THE RESIDUAL LANDSCAPES</p>

<p>The Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies is thrilled to unveil its new feature exhibition, Edward Burtynsky: The Residual Landscapes, showcasing 25 years of the photographer's inspiring and thought-provoking large-scale photographs. <br>
Featured opposite Nickel Tailings #30, Sudbury, Ontario, 1996.</p>

<p>Edward Burtynsky is one of Canada's most respected and celebrated photographers. He's made it his life's work to document humanity's impact on the planet. Burtynsky's riveting images, as beautiful as they are disturbing, capture views of the earth altered by mankind. A mountain of tires, a river of fluorescent orange sludge from a nickel mine and a massive man-made canyon carved deep into the earth to reach its oil riches – these are just some of the many eye-opening images in this moving exhibition.</p>

<p>"These images are meant as metaphors to the dilemma of our modern existence; they search for a dialogue between attraction and repulsion, seduction and fear," said Edward Burtynsky, photographer. "We are drawn by desire – a chance at good living, yet we are consciously or unconsciously aware that the world is suffering for our success. Our dependence on nature to provide the materials for our consumption and our concern for the health of our planet sets us into an uneasy contradiction. For me, these images function as reflecting pools of our times."</p>

<p>Burtynsky's remarkable photographic depictions of global industrial landscapes are in the collections of several major museums around the world including the National Gallery of Canada, the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris, the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York.</p>

<p>This exhibition runs until the 26th of April 2009</p>

<p>GREGORY CREWDSON TALKS</p>

<p>Famed photographer Gregory Crewdson will present the inaugural discussion in a series sponsored by the Photography Society of The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. The artist’s talk is scheduled for 6 p.m. March 12 in Atkins Auditorium at the Museum. Crewdson’s work has been widely exhibited and reviewed. He makes large-scale photographs of elaborate and meticulously staged tableaux, which have been described as “micro-epics” that probe the dark corners of the psyche.</p>

<p>Working in the manner of a film director, he leads a production crew, which includes a director of photography, special effects and lighting teams, casting director and actors. He typically makes several exposures that he later digitally combines to produce the final image. “Crewdson is one of the most daring and inventive contemporary artists using photography,” said Keith F. Davis, Curator of Photography at the Nelson-Atkins. “His meticulously crafted works are immensely rich in both narrative and psychological terms. They prod us to rethink our ‘usual’ relationship to photographs as physical objects and as records of worldly fact. Crewdson is a genuinely important figure in today’s art world. He has an international reputation and has influenced an entire generation of younger photographic artists.”</p>

<p>Attendance to the program is free, but tickets can be obtained in advance online at www.nelson-atkins.org</p>

<p>WORKS 80-08</p>

<p>Moderna Museet presents Andreas Gursky: Works 80-08,  2009. <br>Born in Leipzig in 1955 and living in Düsseldorf, Andreas Gursky has long been considered one of the world’s leading photographers. Works 80-08 presents his entire oeuvre. The artist has selected more than 140 works from nearly three decades, the earliest of which were taken from his immediate surroundings, followed by images from an ever expanding radius, and ending in a global perspective. From distant and elevated vantage points, Andreas Gursky creates photographs that exceed the registering capacity of the eye. By revisiting locations and events repeatedly over an extended period of time, he not only sheds light on various forms of social contexts, such as mass meetings of a Capitalist or Communist nature, but also depicts structures in transformation. <br>The photographs of large corporations and stock markets from the 1980s and onwards are examples of this. The exhibition Works 80-08, featuring many photographs never previously shown, presents both the side of the artist where an individual image becomes an entire universe – the latest images are in Gursky’s well-known large format – as well as his encyclopaedic side. Offering space for the artist’s entire oeuvre has been made possible by the fact that he has produced small-scale copies of earlier works. This radical approach presents a generous opportunity to follow Gursky’s artistic development while at the same time conveying a whole new perspective on the individual art-works.</p>

<p>LOCAL STUDIES</p>

<p>Joël Tettamanti, born in Cameroon in 1977 and grew up in Switzerland, is a traveller between cultures. He takes photographs all over the world, traveling without a guide to unknown places where he gains inspiration for quiet, memorable photographs through chance and unforeseen encounters. <br>He commutes between landscapes in which the presence of man is barely perceptible and cities in which nature has been banned almost entirely. He focuses his analytical and intuitive eye on specific objects with which people have "furnished" their living space: absurd scaffoldings, dense apartment blocks, sprawling settlements and timeless ruins – alien objects, bordering between usefulness and decay, frequently located in a twilit emptiness that reveals their forms and an enigmatic inner relationship. Tettamani's colour photographs, many of them in large format, portray our urban, globalised world in which inconspicuous details and the quality of light subtly evoke meaning in a suggestive way. "Local Studies" is the first comprehensive presentation of Tettamanti's work in Switzerland.</p>

<p>TRANSFORMATIONS</p>

<p>Transformations is a photographic portrait exploration by photographer Paul Rowland, a regular contributor to Exit. The images reflect the artist’s interest in not who is in front of the camera, but rather what one could imagine there.<br>
Taken from the past five years of image-making, this show attempts to distill an underlying current of the artist’s process. Often this results in moments of clarity, which can be haunting while retaining a humor that brings a sense of reality to the image where the moments have often been more heavily constructed.</p>

This exhibition has been selected from the resulting series of photographic works, which Graham published in twelve volumes as, a shimmer of possibility. Each simple but structurally inventive series includes varying numbers of pictures, from one to more than ten, and provides a vivid glimpse into unheralded moments in the lives of individuals Graham encountered on his travels. <br>A series showing a woman eating a take-out meal or a man waiting at a bus stop transcends its nominal subjects and describes aspects of life that, while ordinary, are imbued by the photographer with affection and curiosity. a shimmer of possibility is a call for attention to the brief, indefinite intervals of life. As Graham has said, "Perhaps instead of standing at the river’s edge scooping out water, it’s better to be in the current itself, to watch how the river comes up to you, flows smoothly around your presence, and reforms on the other side like you were never there."</p>

<p>The exhibition runs until March 18th, 2009.</p>

<p>THE LAST DAYS OF W</p>

<p>Gagosian Gallery is pleased to present "The Last Days of W" color photographs taken by Alec Soth between 2000 and 2008.  Although originally conceived without explicit political intent, in retrospect Soth considers this selected body of work, which spans both terms of George W. Bush's presidency, to represent "a panoramic look at a country exhausted by its catastrophic leadership."
 <br>Soth's earlier series such as "Sleeping by the Mississippi," "NIAGARA," and "Dog Days, Bogotá" – all subjective narratives containing disenfranchised figures and decaying landscapes - laid the conceptual groundwork for "The Last Days of W." It provides a wry commentary on the adverse effects of the national administration, perhaps best exemplified by an unwittingly ironic remark that Bush made in 2000: "I think we can agree, the past is over."</p>

<p>The exhibition runs till March 7th, 2009.</p>

<p>TIBERIUS : CHADWICK TYLER</p>

<p>Honey Space Gallery New York, has announced Tiberius, a solo exhibition of new photography by Exit contributor Chadwick Tyler. <br></p>

<p>For his first gallery exhibition, the artist has created a series of original black &amp; white photographic portraits depicting an array of expressive &amp; sullenly beautiful female characters. 
In Tiberius, Tyler juxtaposes the mystery and obscurity of the antiquated image with the clarity of deep emotion: transcendence, rage, ecstasy, hysteria, confusion, lethargy, exhaustion, lament, abjection, resignation, etc. The series is a sort of lexicon of unexplained broken beauty.</p>

<p>The exhibition runs from February 10th till March 12th, 2009.</p>

<p>MADE FOR SKATE</p>

<p>In the skateboard universe the evolution of riding technique, skateboard decks, graphics and art are well documented. Until now, however, skateboard shoes have received little attention. Made for Skate tells the story of skateboard footwear as seen through the eyes of those who lived it. <br>Along with the classics by companies such as Vans, Airwalk, Etnies, and Duffs, it features hard-to-find and one-of-a-kind shoes that emerged throughout almost five decades of skate history - all photographed superlatively.
This book provides an exhaustive overview of the history and styles of skate shoes and is based on the collection of the Museum of Skateboard History in Stuttgart, Germany.</p>

<p>MICHEL COMTE RETROSPECTIVE</p>

<p>Michel Comte was born in Zurich in 1954. He trained as an art restorer and then taught himself photography. In 1979, he received his first advertising commission from Karl Lagerfeld for the fashion label Chloé and moved to Paris. In 1981 he moved to New York and later to Los Angeles for his work on American Vogue. Within the space of a few years, Comte went from being an unknown photographer to being the most wanted man in the business and had established himself as one of the world’s busiest fashion and magazine photographers. He has worked for Vanity Fair and Vogue, and shot portraits of celebrities from the world of art, music, and entertainment including Julian Schnabel, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Mike Tyson, Carla Bruni, and Michael Schumacher, creating icons of portrait photography in the process. But in addition to portrait and fashion photography, Comte is increasingly branching out into journalistic and documentary photography. He has worked for the Red Cross and for his own Water Foundation and has travelled through war zones in Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia, or the Sudan. He is currently working on a film about the atrocities committed during the rule of the Khmer Rouge.</p>

<p>CUSTOMIZED BY SATOSHI MINAKAWA</p>

<p>In contrast to the usual minimalism that we see from Japanese designers and artists, Satoshi Minakawa presents photos of excentric customizations of Japanese vehicles.</p>

<p>“In shot after shot, Minakawa presents vehicles that look as if they came straight off some deranged kabuki set. Nothing looks as if it was ever meant for anything so mundane as road transportation. Gaudy gold fins are welded to the boot of two-wheeler carts. Trucks are festooned with blinding neon signs, their every surface plastered with kanji script and strobe lights. Meanwhile, the fleet of motorbikes and scooters are painted in a resplendent rainbow of glossy blues, reds and blacks; some are even adorned with stylized eyes on the fender.
The overall effect is one of manga Transformers, a split second before they unfold, unclip and spring into life.”</p>

<p>The photographers work is on show at The Printspace in East London, until January 14th.</p>
