<p>CHRISTOPHER WOOL</p>

<p>In tandem with his pattern paintings, Wool developed a body of work that similarly subverted a set of existing forms, this time using language as his appropriated subject matter. Rendering a word or phrase in bold, blocky stencils arrayed across a geometric grid, he preserved the specific form and order of the language, but freely stripped out punctuation, disrupted conventional spacing, and removed letters. The resulting compositions oscillate between verbal communication and pure formalism, with their structural dissonance reflecting the state of anxiety and agitation conjured by the texts themselves.</p>

<p>The silkscreen has been a primary tool for Wool since the 1990s. In his earliest screenprinted paintings, he expanded on the vocabulary of the pattern works, enlarging their stylized floral motifs for use as near-abstract units of composition. In this period, Wool frequently sabotaged his existing forms as a way to covertly generate new ones, layering the flower icons in dense, overlapping configurations that congeal into a single black mass or become obscured with passages of brusque overpainting. He also introduced a new, entirely freehand gesture in the form of a looping line applied with a spray gun—an irreverent interruption of the imagery below that evokes an act of vandalism on a city street.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, Wool’s simultaneous embrace and repression of painting’s expressive potential have culminated in an open-ended vein of works that he refers to as his “gray paintings.” In these large-scale abstractions, Wool alternates between the act of erasing and the act of drawing, repeatedly wiping away sprayed black enamel paint to create layers of tangled lines and hazy washes. The artist describes the cycle of composition and loss inherent to this process as an attempt to harness the condition of doubt into a generative creative force. The same challenge to the authority of the unique, original gesture is extended in Wool’s most recent silkscreened canvases, which use digital processing to warp the scale, color, and resolution of his painted marks, often merging them with details from other paintings.</p>

<p>SEAN SCULLY - TRIPTYCHS</p>

<p>Best known as a painter of monumental works in oil, Sean Scully (b.1945) has garnered international acclaim as one of the most prominent painters in the abstract tradition, fusing the conventions of European painting with the distinct character of American abstraction. This is the first exhibition to explore the artist's engagement with the triptych format, which has obsessed him for nearly three decades. It will feature major paintings, as well as drawings and etchings, from across the last 40 years.</p>

<p>STANLEY DONWOOD - APOCALYPSE BOUTIQUE</p>

<p>The exhibition will showcase a fantastically varied series of rare screen-prints, linoprints, etchings and original canvases. Stanley's art veers from propagandist graphics to introspective illustrations. 
His consistant strength is his ability to combine deep, personal and political emotions with modesty and humour. The weighty subjects are not examined not entirely seriously but certainly respectfully.  Apocalypse Boutique aims to highlight the artist’s unique style and endless diversity.</p>

<p>Amongst the collection will be the last remaining original canvas from the ‘Hail to the Thief’ series, known internationally as the inspiration behind Radiohead’s number one Grammy Award Winning album.  Stanley Donwood has been Radiohead’s in-house artist since he and Thom Yorke met at Exeter University. The powerful visual identity he's created for the band is considered so in tune with Thom Yorke's music that the debate still rages as to whether he and Yorke are one and the same.</p>

<p>PAUL RAMÍREZ JONAS - AGGREGATE</p>

<p>On view in the main gallery, five cork busts present a series of anti-monuments whose conventional forms are subverted by angular cuts to each face that deliberately obscure and de-center the identity of the memorialized figure.</p>

<p>Monuments, commonly fabricated with permanent materials, are often set out of reach with the purpose of inscribing public spaces indelibly. Counter to this tradition, the cork that is used for the Ventriloquist series is covered in pushpins. Each anonymous monolith surrenders its discursive power and submits its authority to a public. In turn, that public will transform each monument into a communal bulletin board by posting its own messages. Ultimately, the Ventriloquist sculptures assert that public voice is not necessarily permanent nor singular; it can instead reflect the fragility, contingency, and plurality of the general populace.</p>

<p>Building upon Ramírez Jonas' earlier Admit One drawings, the new Assembly drawings present overlaid floor plans of multiple designated meeting places and the precise seating arrangements of the assembled publics within them. Stamped admission tickets stand in for every seat that awaits occupation. Whereas each Admit One renders a single architectural site, each Assembly imagines how separate spaces of deliberation (Congress), of action (meeting halls), and of spectacle (cinema) might intersect. Through this process, Assembly reveals unwitting ideological interdependencies and problematizes similarities between seemingly unrelated cultural spaces.</p>

<p>JIMMIE DURHAM</p>

<p>The choice of Brussels for the opening of a second space was motivated by longstanding friendships, close relationships with collectors, museum directors and artists but is also linked to the development over the past years of the Belgian art scene and more particularly that of Brussels's. The gallery will have the pleasure to initially present its European and American artists and to offer the opportunity for Belgian artists to use its space.</p>

<p>The sculptures and drawings that Jimmie Durham offers us provoke in us a desire for dialogue(s). Dialogues with banal objects, which are common or even neglected but unconsciously carry a story and/or a political reality close to that of the artist, unperceived at the first glance.
In fact, the works of Jimmie Durham are indefinable, cannot be categorised and carry on a conversation about their identity, their story, their "life." The artist invites the objects he has found, for example, on long walks with his family and to his studio, plays with them before sending them back into the world in a new way.</p>

<p>Jimmie Durham tells us, "I would like to make art each individual thing there is, there would not be a time when you had to decide to keep it or throw it away. It seems to me one can do that sort of non-dictatorial thing by making things which don't have to do with craftwork at all just intellectually join our normal physical world."</p>

<p>ALINA SZAPOCZNIKOW</p>

<p>The basic principle, the Tartuffe principle, we can call it (Molière's Tartuffe, but not only), endures through the ages and across cultures (Femens in every land, the job has still to be done!): "Cover that breast I cannot bear to see!" Sex, as we know, has a bad reputation.</p>

<p>When explicit it is terrible, dirty or nasty! So leave it to the pornographer and his vile deeds! When more suggestive, half-hearted (or through pursed lips, so to speak), it fares better with the upholders of good taste, but then of course it butters no parsnips. Not that artists have refrained from representing it, and sometimes in the most brutal fashion (from Courbet to Nauman, via Picasso, Man Ray, Molinier, Louise Bourgeois or Lebel), with or without "delectation" for the beholder, as Duchamp used to say. But clearly, like an artistic equivalent of the top shelf, it is clear that these pieces are "curiosities," minor works even when major-format. Fémininmasculin, the exhibition conceived for the Pompidou Centre fifteen years ago by Marie-Laure Bernadac and Bernard Marcadé, showed, however, that sex was neither secondary nor scabrous, but intimately bound up (excuse the expression!) with the process of art itself.</p>

<p>That in fact it expressed more than it revealed through forms whose representation in itself is pretty much an open and shut case: that it cast light on creation from within, we might say. At the time, I regretted and was above all astonished that Alina Szapocznikow did not feature in what was and remains a milestone in the French approach to "gender."</p>

<p>JOSÉ LOUREIRO - OURIÇOS</p>

<p>"Today, I limited myself to a single, wide and long red brushstroke. A workload only akin to the twelve Labors of Hercules. These brushstrokes bring to mind big ships with excess weight at the bow, risking sinking as soon as they set sail but finally managing to go their way." I wrote these lines in a recent (and lengthier) email to a friend of mine, telling him about what I was doing. If I start by quoting my own words it is because they accurately describe the way I’m now working.</p>

<p>Each one of these brushstrokes arises from a particular place, different from all others, and the dimension they acquire essentially depends on the ballast of pigment and oil they carry within. Black is important because it behaves as a catalyst; for example, as it tangentially approaches a red, it intensifies it, rendering it redder. This red – I could have used any other color in this example – is more intense at its center and diffuse at its margins, almost forming a halo. Apparently immobile, these colors fluctuate and never really touch each other, even when they overlap.</p>

<p>Color and brushstroke are a single entity, inextricable. As such, there is time and duration, beginning and end. It is between these two points, and in a scale ranging from disaster to epiphany, that everything is played out. Colors are served in tubes we can buy at the store. We open one of these tubes and become ecstatic with what we see. Only later we understand that colors are like sharp ramparts, so closed in upon themselves that they can only be taken by storm, and with immense effort. We don’t even have exact names for them; despite the fact that they’re always so impeccably labeled. Having one color, we just need to change its place so that it’s no longer the same. Colors communicate between them in an indecipherable code, impervious to the most powerful algorithm. They are as slippery as eels, and sting like urchins. We’ll never discover the Rosetta Stone of colors.</p>

<p>NICK HORNBY - SCULPTURE (1504-2013)</p>

<p>In The Present Is Just a Point, Michelangelo's David has been extruded to a single point. Standing 9-ft tall and made from half a ton of 150-micron marble dust, the apotheosis of human perfection is reduced to zero, the impeccable curves and relaxed contrapposto of David stretched to their endpoint. The horizontal extrusion is stood erect balancing on its tip, supported by a boulder in the same way historic figures are braced by adjacent rocks or conveniently placed tree trunks. In an inversion of the process of carving (removing) to a gesture of modeling (adding), Hornby commissioned a traditional stone carver from Carrera, Italy, to come to London and model a rock in terracotta at his studio.</p>

<p>David's face appears in a second work, this time mirrored upon itself at a degree angle to make a new compound face. The result is an anamorphosis, the face skewed so severely that it is recognizable only from an acute angle. This Pinocchioesque head is suspended in a bronze cage, much like that of Giacometti's Nose. In both the resin and bronze versions, the profile becomes an unsettling moment of aggression, not quite the gun-shaped sculpture of Giacometti, but a startling disfiguration of beauty.</p>

<p>Finally, Hornby departs from his more typical gleaming white curves with nine photographs. Hornby has digitally manipulated Matisse's The Backs (1909-31) in order to extrapolate hypothetical future iterations beyond Matisse's works, themselves a progression further and further into abstraction as the modeling of flesh gave way to geometric forms. In Hornby's simplification, the relationship between figure and ground, already at stake in Matisse's production, falls away, and the compromised forms collapse not into difference but repetition. Unlike the exclamation point of The Present Is Just a Point, the grammatical comparison here would be the ellipses, a subtle fade to black. The trickster makes this world.</p>

<p>ATTILA CSÖRGÕ - SHAPES IN TRANSITION</p>

<p>Combining the media of photography, sculpture, and drawing, the works of Hungarian-born artist Attila Csörgõ offer viewers an intelligent and playful introduction to questions of science and technology. The results are often unexpected, amusing, or even poetic. In long-term experiments the artist explores branches of science such as kinetics, optics, or geometry to examine questions of perception; and on this basis he develops his theories about the construction of reality.</p>

<p>Recent kinetic constructions of the experimental Clock-work series, Clock-work from 2011 and Clockwork (Made in Poland) from 2012, continue his examination of light and motion combined. At the interface of visual arts and science, his work on phenomena of perception finds its focus in the lemniscate, the figure eight lying on its side. Both mathematical symbol and poetic shape, the lemniscate is a symbol of infinity shaped like a horizontal 8. What Csörgõ has built is a 'time machine' which can be read as a sculpture or a three dimensional drawing, a moving picture or simply a scientific experiment.</p>

<p>'Squaring the circle' was originally one of the famous – unsolvable - mathematical tasks coming from the ancient Greek world. It fascinated people during centuries until the final conclusion in the 19th century when mathematicians proved it is unsolvable. Nowadays, metaphorically, we use this phrase for describing a task that is impossible to carry out.</p>

<p>RICHARD PRINCE - PROTEST PAINTINGS</p>

<p>Painted on a vertical canvas in the shape of a protest placard, the Protest Paintings alternate between monochromatic minimalism and richly layered colourful abstraction. Incorporating recycled jokes, printed and hand-written, as well as mined pattern details silkscreened onto the canvas, these paintings are characteristic of Prince’s tenet of appropriation. A mainstay in his oeuvre, the classic one-liners offer comic respite, whilst also challenging the antipathy between high and low art. Masking a menacing truth behind a veil of humour, the jokes are subversive in their purpose.</p>

<p>Purposefully ambiguous, the scrawled slogans resist interpretation, enacting their very own protest through language. Refusing to conform to the standards of the art value system, the Protest Paintings seemingly channel the spirit of the 1960’s counterculture, a defining era to which Prince bore witness.</p>

<p>Featuring paintings from public and private collections, the exhibition demonstrates the breadth of Prince’s creativity in this singular body of work. The range of paintings on show includes monochrome canvases with printed and handwritten jokes, patterned canvases with block text and brightly coloured abstract compositions overlaid with graffiti and drip marks.</p>

<p>In contrast to the formulaic design of the earlier Monochrome Joke paintings, in the Protest Paintings we see Prince’s full creative involvement. Carefully assembling different segments of canvas to form the symbolic crossbow shape of the protest placard, Prince combines gestural brushstrokes with under-painting, silkscreen and disjointed signs, to create a palimpsest of art historical reference and his own particular brand of humour. A visual expression of the performativity that is both characteristic of a protest and a constant element throughout Prince’s oeuvre, the Protest Paintings are a masterful example of Prince’s unique artistic practice.</p>

<p>PAOLA PIVI</p>

<p>Pivi creates artworks that are disorienting and simultaneously poetic. Though formally different, her work pushes the limit of what can be done in this world as an artwork. Her first comprehensive solo exhibition in the United States will take over both floors of the gallery and feature exclusive new 
works. On the ground floor, Pivi will present an installation of eight fantastic creatures. The polars bears will return in Paola’s art! An unexpected performing 
sculpture, “Money machine (true blue, baby I love you)” will also be on display on the lower level, evoking the topography of the New York building which was previously a bank and hosted a vault.</p>

<p>Nomadic by nature, Paola Pivi has lived all over the world, including Shanghai, the remote island of Alicudi in southern Italy, and Anchorage, Alaska. She is 
presently in India. Pivi first exhibited at Viafarini in Milan in 1995, the same year she enrolled in the Brera Academy of Art in Milan. In 1999, she was co-awarded 
the Golden Lion for the best national pavilion (Italy) at Harald Szeemann’s Venice Biennial. For this venue, which featured five Italian artists, Pivi presented “Untitled (airplane)”, an inverted Fiat G-91 airplane resting on its cockpit.</p>

<p>PAUL KLEE - MAKING VISIBLE</p>

<p>Paul Klee - Making Visible begins with the artist’s breakthrough during the First World War, when he first developed his individual abstract patchworks of colour that later became characteristic of his ‘magic square’ paintings.
The heart of the exhibition will focus on the decade Klee spent teaching and working at the Bauhaus, the hotbed of modernist design. The abstract canvases he produced there, such as the rhythmical composition Fire in the Evening 1929, took his reputation to new international heights.</p>

<p>The 1930s then brought about radical changes. Having moved to Düsseldorf, Klee was dismissed from his new teaching position by the Nazis and took refuge in Switzerland with his family, while his works were removed from collections and labelled ‘degenerate art’ in Germany. Despite the political turmoil, financial insecurity and his declining health, he nevertheless became even more prolific.</p>

<p>BERNARDI ROIG - PRACTICES TO SMELL THE LIGHT</p>

<p>The tenor of the exhibition is set by a life-size figure, blocked in with his hands tied behind his back, trying, like a symbol of a singular purpose, to lick a light bulb and to energize the empty space around the spectator's body. Another smaller figure, in a desperate attempt to smell the light, is crushed by a cascade of fluorescent light. There no longer is a place for the image to adapt to the eye, everything rushes towards an internal abyss.</p>

<p>Since the end of the 80's, Bernardí Roig has been unfolding the disturbing experience of obsession.  On occasion, his works have a reflective quality, trapping and deforming our image or placing us on the other side of a theatrical scene waiting for its characters. The scene is always difficult, frozen or pierced by an artificial light.</p>

<p>All the work developed by Bernardí Roig over these years has been produced in the shadow of two questions that are essential to him: how to deal with inherited iconographic repertoires and how to continue to create a persistent image, an image that hurls us towards a psychic precipice, in a world overflowing with images. His work, greatly influenced by literature and cinema, follows a path marked by the narrative and a theatrical approach to space.</p>

<p>The exhibition aims to formulate a reflection on the nature of collective perceptions in an era strongly marked by the domination of the media and the virtual world, which, with the overload of hyper-codified messages, surpasses the individual's threshold of endurance. The endless flow of media signals has established the supremacy of language over the authenticity of experience and, with an excess of information, has hidden that which by its very nature cannot be spoken: the primary drive that inhabits the very basis of awareness. If reason is the expression of language, then pantomime is the expression of the body.</p>

<p>LIU YE</p>

<p>In contrast to his contemporaries, his atmospheric paintings are based mainly on his knowledge of the tradition of European painting from Romanticism through Biedermeier to Modernism. Therefore Liu Ye's visual cosmos is filled with protagonists of European cultural history: Hans-Christian Andersen, Piet Mondrian, Balthus, and again and again Miffy, a legendary figure from children's books, conceived by Dutchman Dick Bruna in 1955.</p>

<p>His paintings form a unique synthesis of Chinese culture and European painting, weaving together fairytales, erotic fantasies, and an admiration of the purity of Bauhaus and De Stijl. But at the same time his paintings and their time-consuming process of creation remain always deeply connected to the notions of contemplation typical of Chinese painting. Abstract and figurative elements no longer seem like contradictory poles. Fairytale-like and seemingly idyllic depictions encounter motifs that only appear to be naïve. In some of his most recent paintings, for example, we see crayons and colouring sheets for children. This results in an ingenious play between a naïve subject and the subtly executed painting. And the two paintings in the exhibition that are devoted to the history of the Bauhaus style – a first for Liu Ye – oscillate between a monochrome plane and a three-dimensional object.<br>His paintings derive their power and meaning from the tension of alleged opposites, which are brought into harmony. In this way, Liu Ye points to the Asian roots of his thinking as an artist.</p>

<p>ADRIAN VILLAR ROJAS - TODAY WE REBOOT THE PLANET</p>

<p>Working with a team collaborating builders, sculptors and engineers, Villar Rojas tests the limits of clay to create an apparently fossilised world of ruins and ancient monuments that play with the concept of time, history, modernity and the future. Overarching connections between his projects create a larger narrative, with themes and forms reappearing and reconfiguring themselves over time. As with My Dead Family, which saw him create a 28-metre long sculpture of a whale stranded in a forest for the Bienniale at the End of The World, each installation can seem as if is the last chapter of an unknown mythical saga.</p>

<p>For his first exhibition in the UK, Villar Rojas re-casts this potent mix of myth and imagination responding to the Serpentine Sackler Gallery, a former ammunition store (The Magazine) built in 1805. Taking inspiration from the brick-vaulted Powder Rooms that sit at the centre of the building, the artist will re-imagine the architecture and original purpose of the new Gallery at the very moment it is revealed to the world for the first time. Drawing on the artist's self-declared fascination with topics as diverse as science fiction, comic books, popular music and quantum mechanics, his often fantastical sculptures appear as relics from an invented antiquity or an imagined future.</p>

<p>A key element to his installation at the Serpentine Sackler Gallery is the implicit presence of another parallel site of production, a traditional brickworks in Rosario, Argentina which - alongside its daily production of bricks - functions as a laboratory of artistic experimentation for Villar Rojas. The farm produces handmade bricks, using the ancient method of mixing the raw materials in the ground using animal power before hand firing them in glowing pyramidal towers. The immediacy and rawness of this production process, which drew Villar Rojas to the brickworks as well as aspects of the work there, will appear as 'ghosts' in the exhibition. This return to an old and traditional practice - similar to that of returning to clay as material and sculpture as a form - is the artist's path for inventing a symbolic world that speaks to our imagination as much as it does to the politics of a global economy.</p>

<p>FEODOR VORONOV - RELICS</p>

<p>Voronov's newest works feature his emblematically bold color palette and obsessive mark making techniques, but stem from new source material. His vibrant abstractions of words and letters become monuments to his visual thought process and interest in the interconnectivity of language, thus acting as literal and figurative Relics of his practice.</p>

<p>In establishing his painterly exploration of the socially explicit and implied perceptions of a word, Voronov has visually conceptualized the idiosyncrasies, structure, and comprehension of human communication. Each canvas features an object-like knot of fine ballpoint pen lines, gestural swaths of spray paint, and whimsical bands of marker ink floating within a raw canvas womb, as if illustrating the intricate nature of language's evolution. Voronov's seemingly organic marks co-exist alongside regimented patterns, thus emphasizing the respectively colloquial and formal aspects to our daily parlance.</p>

<p>Though he has been working from a single list of vocabulary words for nearly three years, Voronov has now turned his attention to their amassed combination and composition, likening syntax to the analytical configuration of imagery. Inspired by John Chamberlain's 2012 retrospective at the Guggenheim, Voronov drew from the amalgamations of his metal sculptures, impressed by their feigned weightlessness despite their "hulking masses and multitudes of fractured and jumbled planes." Much like Voronov's own work, these assemblages gave material formality to the tensions, balance, and anatomy of composition, be it physical or intellectual. Stemming from this idea, Voronov's Relics reference terms and phrases from a long, rambling paragraph he calls his "piggy bank" – an autobiographical stream of consciousness – that allows for the advanced entanglements competing focal points. More than ever, the viewer will find evolving entry points and altered senses of perspective in Voronov's paintings, analogous to the individualized way in which we converse.</p>

<p>LUTZ BACHER - BLACK BEAUTY</p>

<p>Black Beauty is the first major solo exhibition in the UK by American artist Lutz Bacher. Occupying an important position in contemporary art practice, Lutz Bacher’s work is receiving increasing levels of international recognition. Black Beauty provides a unique opportunity to see Bacher’s new works made specifically for the ICA together with recent work for the first time in London.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of her career in the 1970s, Bacher has drawn upon disconnected information from popular culture and her own life, producing works that play with the interchangeability of identity, sexuality and the human body. Bacher uses images and objects in a physical, sometimes visceral manner, conducting arrangements of seemingly disparate entities and allowing them to interact in new ways. The artist’s expansive work explores human identity as it is defined through gender, sexuality and the human body. Lutz Bacher is as elusive as her work is ambiguous, perhaps preferring not to dictate how her works should be viewed.</p>

<p>The exhibition at the ICA presents new and recent works which combine striking installations with film, sound and sculpture. At the core of the exhibition is Black Beauty (2012), several tons of coal slag which will flow throughout the lower gallery. This piece is paired with a sound work, Puck (2012) which envelopes the viewer as they move through the space. The audio recording of the character Puck at the conclusion of Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream is repeated with different emphases and pronunciations. Black Magic (2013) is a new site specific work made from black vibrating ‘astroturf’ that will be displayed along the full length of the concourse in the lower gallery.</p>

<p>IFEOMA ANYAEJI - TRANSMOGRIFICATION</p>

<p>Ifeoma Anyaeji's recent sculpture employs a virtuosic ability to create elegant forms drawn from architecture and domestic furniture design through the reconstruction of found objects such as the ubiquitous plastic bags and bottles.</p>

<p>She utilizes a process that is physically and conceptually steeped in memory, history and the passage of time to create work that radically put into question conventional notions of what sculpture is. Using hair plaiting technique known as Threading from her homeland, she threads and braids discarded plastic bags into plasto-yarns which she combines with strong compositional organization to create complex yet lyrical assemblages of everyday objects that reflect subtle understanding of context and awareness of the relationship between function and experimentation.<br>There is an abiding urge in her work to highlight the relevance of social responsibility to the environment in today's hyper-consumer society as she engages with the cyclical nature of production, accumulation and regeneration in the creative process, and as stated by the artist "My concept of material reuse through the transformation of an object's physical state, is to echo the environmental implication of accumulation and the extensiveness of a politicized archeology of modernity's consumptive system".</p>

<p>JACK VETTRIANO - A RETROSPECTIVE</p>

<p>This retrospective exhibition showcases such key paintings as Dance me to the end of Love (1998), Mad Dogs (1992), Long Time Gone (2006), Bluebird at Bonneville (1996) and The Billy Boys (1994). Alongside these classic, romantically themed paintings for which Vettriano is perhaps best known, this exhibition will also feature extensive examples of his powerfully erotic works such as Game On (1999), The Parlour of Temptation (1996), An Imperfect Past (2000), Fetish (1998 )and Night Geometry (1996). All the paintings featured in this exhibition are on loan from private collections and many are going on public display for the first time in close to 20 years.</p>

<p>Jack Vettriano said: “I was deeply touched when approached by Kelvingrove Art Gallery about staging a Retrospective exhibition for me, having long since been an admirer of their collections and overall ethos. Exhibiting in such majestic surroundings is a great honour and one for which I am extremely grateful. I look forward to spending some time in Glasgow and renewing my acquaintance with some of my favourite paintings in Kelvingrove’s Collection, works by the likes of Van Gogh and the Scottish Colourists that, in many ways, inspired me to become an artist at the outset.</p>

<p>It will not be without some considerable emotion that I will also be reunited with some of my own paintings; works that span 20 years of my career and many of which I have not seen in years. I’ve been very lucky that my works have found their way into a diverse range of private collections around the world over the years and I am most grateful to the owners for so kindly loaning their paintings back for this special exhibition.”</p>

<p>WENDY WHITE - PICK UP A KNOCK</p>

<p>Furthering her concept of the Sports Moment and addressing specifically the inclination in professional soccer toward "flopping," Wendy White has created an installation of 5 single canvas paintings and 4 large-scale inkjet printed photographs on vinyl. The painting installation is completed with wall-to-wall white Astroturf installed on the gallery's floor.</p>

<p>Flopping, or as Spanish-speaking countries refer to it, clavado (literally meaning nailed), is a strategy used to trick the referee into calling a foul. While other participating countries have long accepted this regular occurrence, Americans have long been reticent towards such a strategy, as it defines them as the underdog and is a sign of weakness. Our longstanding global position as one of power and winning is antithetical to the idea of failing as a means towards success. It has become so ubiquitous in the game that an aerosol pain medication, often referred to as Magic Spray, is now widely. When a player flops, trainers rush out and spray them, then they return to the game as if nothing happened.</p>

<p>In counterpoint, White investigates the history of her own gym in the Chinatown neighborhood of NYC, where numerous older patrons work out on broken equipment. The building housing the gym was raided a year ago for illegal gambling and fake doctors prescribing medicine without a license. The location is 35-37 E. Broadway, the same street where the first aerosol pain medication was invented in the 1860s, at the height of the E. Broadway gang activity.</p>

<p>HEATHER GWEN MARTIN - PATTERN MATH</p>

<p>Pattern Math is Heather Gwen Martin's third solo exhibition with the gallery and continues her exploration of abstraction in painting.  Martin's work eschews conceptual strategies in favor of a very personal and intuitive approach that allows for a broad reading and interpretation. Thoughtful and straightforward, it combines a near-scientific sense of control over a number of formal and organic elements that direct the viewer onto multiple paths of experience.  Her paintings can be seen to function as experimental fields?dynamic, spatial environments where energies and forces from the real world and the otherly imagined are brought into play, imposing upon and affecting one another. These forces are not necessarily measureable or quantifiable; rather they enliven the field through a complex matrix of factors: bold colors animate closely shifting hues and values; fluid, sinuous lines expand and contract in and out of intumescent shapes, bending space and creating precisely sculpted forms.  Numerous layers of finely applied paint conceal and reveal, leaving ghostly, fragmentary traces and producing residual effects that challenge the eye and the mind.</p>

<p>Since first taking advantage of UCSD's renowned cognitive studies program as a student, Martin continues to be interested in how we respond to stimuli and different interfaces in the world.  "This particular interest in perception and visual processing", says Martin, "points to a focused concern on the understanding of  abstraction, relating to composition with the nuance of shapes and relationships between forms that leads to making connections and associations from within the painting itself or from external influences.  As the responses to my paintings reverberate from real and imagined instances where disparate forces come together for but brief moments, they function as a means of communication and an experience in physical reality not obstructed, altered, or interrupted by technology and artificial/non-physical interaction."</p>

<p>STANLEY DONWOOD</p>

<p>Far Away is Close at Hand in Images of 
Elsewhere showcases Stanley’s ambitious ink and pencil pieces featuring hidden 
country footpaths, Known as Holloways, 
and other arboreal scenes. These are 
featured in Stanley’s hit book of the same 
name, published by Faber and Faber earlier 
this year. The large canvases to be shown 
alongside them formed the official artwork 
for Radiohead’s latest LP, The King of 
Limbs, named after an ancient oak tree in Savernake Forest, Wiltshire.
Holloway lanes are characterised by an over-arching avenue of fauna that creates a natural tunnel effect. 
Mysterious and melancholic, their botanical beauty inspires both awe and a liberating sense of feral 
mindfulness. Stanley’s artworks depicting holloways on display will range from miniature woodcut prints and 
studies to large works on paper. The King of Limbs canvases were created using oils and spray paint.</p>

<p>“In the lead up to making these pieces I became fascinated with the idea of a cathedral of sound,” says the 
artist, “I was working with Radiohead on the record that was to become The King of Limbs, and my early 
hearings of the music seemed to suggest an overarching canopy of detail.”
The band’s ambitious compositions triggered a synaesthetic vision in Stanley. “I had a kind of memory that the 
fluted columns and ceiling tracery of medieval churches owed its inspiration to the northern forests of Europe; 
the tall tree trunks, the interlaced branches above, the majesty of the woods. I wanted to take this caged spirit of 
the trees back into the forests, where sounds were free and un-tethered by religion, where the spreading 
branches supported the sky, not the roof of a church. I began to paint trees, bright, coloured trees, through 
which dark mists could percolate.”</p>

<p>DANIEL LERGON - POTENTIAL EISEN</p>

<p>The Berlin based painter Daniel Lergon shows paintings and drawings of his latest body of work. Powdered and neutrally bound iron on canvas and paper functions as the work's base coat. The iron particles on the painting's surface oxidate by applying acidified water and therefore determine the modulation of form and color. The potential of the painting's surface is chemically aroused, unlike in his earlier work series on fluorescent or retro reflective material that was physically changed by applying transparent lacquer. As then light played a major and form giving role, now the process of pictorial invention is made visible in different levels of materiality. The charged material and the artist's response to it influence the pictorial invention.</p>

<p>ADRIAN NAVARRO - RED SPACE</p>

<p>Navarro plays with transforming the perception of the spectator, generating an intense and dramatic ambience. Red in all its variants, from scarlet to carmine, passing through cadmium and alizarin, reflects the protagonism of the colour and discovers for us sensations "which only painting can provoke through colour understood as a source of radiant energy" according to the artist.  The expression of colour as a malleable pictorial substance is appreciated through loose brushstrokes, spontaneous and rhythmic tracings running across the canvas.</p>

<p>Rhythm, like colour, is fundamental in the work of Adrián Navarro. In a certain way, the surface of the picture hides from us the complexity of the tension between the interior, corporal and gestural rhythm, and the exterior rhythm, rigorous in its repetition. This duality expresses a hybrid space, a reflection of the human mind, where rational conscience co-exists with intuition.</p>

<p>RICHARD SERRA - TRAJECTORY</p>

<p>This exhibition focuses on three groups of etchings from the past ten years. Extension and Trajectory are both part of the Arc of the Curve series from 2004, and examine movement through space and the curve of a line, from broad, sweeping gestures to slight bends and turns. Some lean dramatically; others stoop. In contrast, Ballast (2011), is a series dealing with weight, stability and control; the black mass sits at the bottom of the sheet, revealing a small glimpse of white paper at the top. These prints are serious, minimal and sculptural - a closer look at their surface reveals a highly pitted, three-dimensional, intaglio landscape.</p>

<p>In order to achieve the texture in these etchings, a ‘found' surface in the form of an exterior stucco wall was used. Frosted mylar was taped to the wall and then lithographic rubbing ink was applied. The texture of the wall was then transferred to a copper plate photographically using a light sensitive emulsion, and the plate was then subjected to the traditional etching process using a tank of acid (Ferric Chloride).</p>

<p>AMY HILL - THE AGE OF DELIGHTENMENT</p>

<p>Hill composes contemporary scenes inspired by pious gestures and devout expressions of Fifteenth century Flemish altarpieces and portraits. Her past series portrayed "Bikers" via Rembrandt and "Bohemians" a la Memling, now she turns worshippers of Mary into "Goth Girls."  Featured in this exhibition will be Amy Hill's "Seven Deadly Sins" series, in which Hill references the central panel of Han Memling's Triptych of Earthly Vanity and Divine Salvation.  The figure's pose and the iconography are transmuted to relate a contemporary update on the concept of the seven deadly sins.  Apathy, Distraction, Deprivation, Nymphomania, Paranoia, Syntheticity and Workaholism replace the traditionally known sins, reflecting the current vices plaguing society.  While the structure of each painting retains elemental features of Memling's Vanity, Hill redirects their reference to contemporary associations.</p>

<p>Amy Hill's series "Women in Goth Clothing" relates the history of portraiture through the history of fashion. Clothing elements of the past, such as large ruffled collars, puffed-up sleeves and the folds of draping fabric can be seen as the primary concern in compositions of many well-known images.  Hill considers the historical poses that accentuate these fashions and utilizes them as a departure point, attributing contemporary clothing trends as an indicator of current times. Hill retains the primary characterizations of 15th century Flemish art with her use of idealism and experimentation with perspective, creating portraits that are a contemporary reflection of the past. The subjects of her paintings are chosen from the fringes of society where there is more self-expression and give a more impactful view of today's society.</p>

<p>HERNAN BAS - DEEP IN THE DARK OF TEXAS</p>

<p>Hernan Bas will be showing new medium and large-format paintings on canvas and linen, and several works on paper. Hernan Bas created this new body of work during an artist residency at the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas. Marfa became an artist colony of sorts in the 1970s when Donald Judd moved there and founded the Chinati Foundation. Located in the Chihuahuan Dessert close to the Mexican border, Marfa is indeed deep in the dark of Texas, as the exhibition title implies.</p>

<p>Vast, sprawling landscapes have inhabited the paintings of Hernan Bas for some time now, so the impressions Bas gathered during his residency in Texas seem like a natural continuation of his theme. The painting There's just no point in crying accentuates the shimmering heat with the yellow and white horizon in the background, while a young man stands silently in the center front, looking down on a grave (2013, acrylic and airbrush on linen, 182 x 152 cm, shown on invitation card). Inspired by the aesthetics of the male androgynous dandy, Hernan Bas constructs an account of adolescent exploration. In other instances the suggested narratives may double as metaphors for a sexual and sensual awakening. Usually portrayed alone amidst their surroundings, the youths in Hernan Bas's paintings reside in a utopian world of instinctive sensuality.</p>

<p>The detailed surfaces of the exhibited paintings are full of vibrant colors layered in broad brushstrokes. Despite the large formats of his paintings, Hernan Bas continues to work without studio assistants, thus maintaining a maximum operating range. Recently, Hernan Bas has explored and expanded on printing techniques, which he combines with painting to add texture to his works. The exhibition is completed with the presentation of smaller works on paper, which address the same thematic realm.</p>

<p>The object as messenger<br>
As intermediary, as immutable screen Color as mediated reflection<br>
Wow and flutter<br>
Time and volume as borne by distance, area<br>
Data like taffy: pulled, dyed</p>

<p>These new works reflect the difference between the painted surface and the computer screen. Simple materials and minimal decisions strikingly illustrate the ones and zeros of data as represented by on/off areas of color shifting through the RGB spectrum across the surface of the work.</p>

<p>Specifically, the works are split amongst different patterns and titled after these patterns as metaphors for data. Checkerboard works are like bits of information (while also recalling the blank Cartesian slate in photoshop) Works which feature parallel lines reference the form of computer and audio magnetic tape.</p>

<p>MERIÇ ALGÜN RINGBORG - A WORK OF FICTION</p>

<p>The exhibition comprises 3 main bodies of work: an environment, an audio narrative, and a manuscript for a novel – all characterizing the idea of an author and constructed using exemplifying sentences from the dictionary.</p>

<p>The environment, first compiled as a list of objects then manifested physically in the space, reflects the idea of an authors’ space and makes for a framework for the act of making. The audio narrative, titled Metatext, echoing in the space, mediates on the act of writing itself. Almost like a self-reflective script, it explores writing through its own making and through what it says and intimates. Here we encounter the apparent author speaking of a book recently written: I was toying with the idea of writing a book. A work of fiction. I didn’t know what I was doing. And I have to say. The first sentence is so hard to compose.</p>

<p>Finally, a novel, presented in manuscript form within the environment uses the same methodology in which nothing is written but rather compiled. It tells a detective-like story following the characters Maria, Mark and Peter. Romantic relationships develop into drama, murder and whatever else one might find in a more generic crime, romance or thriller book. The puzzling manner of writing reveals the methodology of its authoring as the story progresses.</p>

<p>IGSHAAN ADAMS - HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?</p>

<p>The title of the exhibition references fabled sayings by Mullah Nasiruddin, the 13th century Seljuq satirical Sufi who is often referred to as "the wise fool". Adams identifies with the populist philosopher's often humorous searches for God in domestic and other commonplace objects.</p>

<p>The exhibition features installation works and embroideries. The latter represents furniture pieces based on particular objects of personal, family and religious significance. Adams renders the objects incomplete, or with structural weaknesses counter to their quotidian functionality. The array of predominantly textile-based installations allude to disturbances within the comforts of home: explicating what happens when home becomes a place of danger.</p>

<p>The personal narrative that runs through the work culminates in If that I Knew, the largest installation in the exhibition. The focal point of this work is a carpet of prayer mats representing a prone dog juxtaposed with the patterns and architectural elements inherent in the design of the carpets. Adams explains: "In Islam the dog is considered an impure animal. Superimposing the image of the dog on the Holy City is an act of claiming a stake despite rejection and ridicule. All the works in this body are conversations: between God and myself, moments and experiences. These conversations are often argumentative, conflictual, yet, intimate and at times reassuring."</p>

<p>AI WEIWEI - BABY FORMULA</p>

<p>Following China’s 2008 melamine milk scandal, thousands of children who consumed the tainted milk fell ill and some even met their death. Mainlanders concerned about the safety of Chinese-produced baby milk formula resorted to purchasing milk powder from overseas and bringing it back to China. Subsequently, governments in Hong Kong and across Europe reacted to this surge in demand by enforcing restrictions on the number of cans mainlanders could purchase overseas.</p>

<p>Determined to initiate positive change and undeterred by the restrictions that the Chinese authorities had enforced, Ai Weiwei used Twitter to reach out to an even wider audience. For his exhibition in Singapore, Ai Weiwei has developed two series of prints selected from his tweets surrounding the safety of the mainland-produced baby milk formula. These prints will be shown together with an 860 square-foot installation – a map of China composed of more than 1,800 cans of baby formula.</p>

<p>By subverting instituted notions of culture and the role and form of art, Ai Weiwei’s works question the value of the status quo. Drawing from Andy Warhol’s philosophy that one must change things oneself; Ai Weiwei’s art is a force for change. During his twelve years spent in New York, Ai Weiwei’s exposure to Marcel Duchamp’s work was crucial in his artistic development; it shifted his perspective towards one that recognized art as a gesture, which could assume any form the artist chose. Consequently, many of the materials he uses are recycled in order to reflect that people are not free to do what they want, namely to use their imagination.</p>

<p>KARL BURKE &amp; MAUD COTTER</p>

<p>Both Cotter and Burke have an innate capacity to create liner forms, resulting in a system of drawing in three dimensions. This approach respects the inner geometry present in their work – something that is incisive, formally economical and witty.</p>

<p>Karl Burke’s work is primarily concerned with perceptions of space and time and takes the form of installations, photographs, video and sound works. In an on-going body of work “wooden drawings” Burke places uniform lengths of processed wood in various situations in a particular environment, specifically in relation to different aspects of that space or place.</p>

<p>Maud Cotter’s work is an exploration of human presence and its indivisible relationship with the material world. To unlock the possibilities within this fundamental relationship is part of the challenge of the work. Within this, understanding physicality and the nature of energy is a central concern.</p>

<p>DALE FRANK - NOBODY'S SWEETIE</p>

<p>Dale Frank’s paintings are characterised by an immediacy of process and a tense urgency of vision, the method of which he has mastered over several decades. Despite the appearance of serendipity, Frank controls his dynamic and intense process to achieve highly conscious outcomes. The images are literally brought to the surface through calculated action as the varnishes becomes thicker and more complex, trapping the colours and the evidence of the process under the surface, creating a depth of pictorial space and a three dimensionality.</p>

<p>The resulting chromatic arrangements are metaphysical universes referring as much to the spirit and to emotions as to physical spaces. The paintings allude to the awe and wonder of all consuming black holes, powerful magnetic stars and galactic collisions, gateways that connect points in space and time leading to other dimensions, forces of gravity – it is as if he were tapping into the energies of a collective unconscious and of the abstract.</p>

<p>DAVID RENGGLI - SCARAMOUCHE</p>

<p>David Renggli, in some respects a prodigy of the Swiss art scene – has repeatedly aroused the curiosity of the public for more than ten years thanks to a unique mixture of themes and forms, of spectacle, humour and poetry. An unexpected combination of various everyday materials and motifs characterises the artist’s heterogeneous repertoire consisting of sculptural objects, installations, photographs and reverse glass paintings. He frequently creates what appears familiar but which on closer examination reveals itself as surreal, absurd and grotesque. The moment of surprise is thus again and again the main aesthetic principle in David Renggli’s work.</p>

<p>The Swiss artist is on the one hand interested in details to mark out what is special and enable a deeper insight but he is not afraid of grand gestures such as recently seen at the exhibition «The Charm of Ignorance» at Museum Bellpark Kriens (2012): Renggli filled all the museum walls with more than 2,000 collaged pictures in Petersburg hanging. His constant experimentation with classical museum displays as well as with art genres and motifs is a repeated theme in his work.</p>

<p>MAPPING THE ABSTRACTION</p>

<p>Mapping the Abstract presents three artists who approach abstract painting with a remarkably fresh perspective. While today the idea of The Abstract typically provokes notions of technology and digital media, each Benjamin Brett, Blake Daniels, and Robert Fry consider abstraction as an organic and gestural process – proving that perhaps painting  –  one of the most conventional of disciplines  – ultimately triumphs as perhaps the most experimental,  exhilarating, and enduring of all media.</p>

<p>Perhaps the beings in Blake Daniels’ works come across as the most overtly humanoid and narrative based, yet his paintings are concerned with what is happening on a much more complex scale in which he is omniscient creator of his own diegesis. His works depict bodies and spaces that have been dislocated and fragmented through the externalization of imagined space. But is narrative of any importance here at all? Certainly any linear-narrative takes a secondary role to the relationship that occurs tangentially: their textural quality, their daring and off-kilter compositions, the abundance of oblong shapes that might suggest limbs, tongues, plants, animals, or viscera, or  conversely, that may exist within the confines of the painting just because.</p>

<p>Similarly, Myriam Blundell writes that Robert Fry’s “enduring preoccupation is to find a visual equivalent to the metaphysical space separating the act of representation from the language of abstraction”. While the suggestion of the figure is central to Fry’s practice, it is the relationship between the being, the surrounding, and the paint itself wherein which Fry finds his locus. Here we are most drawn into his mark-making, the atypical color-choices and painterly confidence that affirm Fry’s world. The omnipresence of variations on a deep purple color (while un-gendered, is historically linked to royalty and piety) becomes Fry’s trademark of-sorts, where shadows, anatomical extensions, and dismembered body parts strangely summon thoughts of deepened psychological states, not unlike Rorschach inkblots. But something about his color choice becomes undeniably carnal - references to Bacon, Guston, Twombly, (and, in Man with Vesalius Skeleton, even Dutch anatomist Andreas Vesalius) - but the languages and landscapes emerge as undoubtedly Fry’s own creation.      </p>

<p>REINVENTING ABSTRACTION</p>

<p>This exhibition focuses on New York abstraction in the 1980s as 
practiced by a generation of painters born between 1939 and 1949. 
Official accounts of the 1980s, the decade when most of these 
artists either emerged or solidified their approaches, tend to ignore 
the individualistic abstraction exemplified by these painters in favor 
of more easily identifiable movements and styles (Neo-Expressionism, 
Appropriation Art, Neo-Geo etc). For these artists, who were in their 30s and 40s during the 1980s, it was not a question of a “return to painting,” but, rather, of finding a bridge between the radical, deconstructive abstraction of the late 1960s and 1970s (which many of them had 
been marked by) with a larger painting history and more subjective 
approaches. They opened their work to elements that had been largely 
excluded from abstraction in the previous decade, beginning with a 
reinvestigation of the conventional rectangular support. They were 
unafraid to explore gesture, improvisation, relational compositions, 
allusions to figuration and landscape, as well as art historical and 
cultural allusions, high and low.</p>

<p>The 1939-1949 bracket encompasses a generation marked by the 1960s, by the social and political 
upheavals of the period. Rejecting formalism, these artists found diverse means of introducing new content into their work; their abstraction was frequently an impure abstraction. In the early 1980s, biomorphic imagery began to appear in the paintings of Carroll Dunham, Bill Jensen, Thomas Nozkowski and Terry Winters. Other artists such as Elizabeth Murray, Joan Snyder and Mary Heilmann injected autobiography into their work. Explicit references to historical events appeared in the paintings of Louise Fishman and Jack Whitten. In the 1980s, painters such as Stanley Whitney and Stephen Mueller were fighting their way out of Color Field painting, gradually assembling the components of noteworthy personal styles.</p>

<p>THE READER - MIXED DEALINGS</p>

<p>Traveling repeatedly throughout the US, The Reader has quite literally made a name for himself that is there for all to see. Leaving a mass of public adornments for over a decade, Reader has maintained an illusiveness and anonymous presence in a desolate grey zone between so called "street art" and graffiti. In recent years Reader carried his oft-cryptic messages of literacy and inquiry into the gallery at the encouragement of his longtime friend Elias Hansen (Lawrimore Project, Seattle 2011).</p>

<p>A scavenger and "relocator" of the discarded and overlooked, Reader transforms untraceable detritus into the foundations of mixed media screen prints and sculptures. His workspace resembles a "byproduct chop-shop" more than it does a traditional artist's studio.</p>

<p>Characteristic of his work is the striking and recurrent use of text. Reader revives now nearly obsolete newspaper boxes and presents them in a context suggestive of ulterior purposes. The boxes themselves, isolated from their natural environment, appear to be salvaged by any available means. Scorched and mutilated they are newly employed by a rival enterprise. Metal sheets accented with both vibrant and weathered hues are welded together in a patchwork reminiscent of color field painting.</p>

<p>Both unavoidable and hidden amongst the layers, Reader's works are dealt through a range of materials. Some give clues to process and approach, others leave open a wide scope of interpretation, and all represent real work. That is the kind that is done outdoors and leaves one dirty. As the show title alludes to, Mixed Dealings is the result of a multifaceted discipline and uncertain means. Reader may not be hacking at establishment, as much as he is attempting to forge one anew.</p>

<p>JOAO MARIA GUSMEO &amp; PEDRO PAIVA</p>

<p>Gusmão and Paiva explore references of existentialism in the philosophical tradition, metaphysical literature, as well as Alfred Jarry's proto-surrealism. The exhibition takes its title from a philosophical question proposed by William Molyneux to John Locke about the recovery of sight. If a man born blind can feel the differences between shapes such as spheres and cubes, could he similarly distinguish those objects by sight if given the ability to see? This problem is mentioned by Locke in his An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, regarding the basis of knowledge and the mechanisms of thought in the human mind.</p>

<p>In the first room of the exhibition, eight bronze sculptures propose alegories on the nature of images, optical illusions and physical phenomena. In Coisas Redondas [Round Things], a series of circular objects are connected in such a way that they look square from certain angles. Bola de tênis [Tennis Ball] reproduces the movement of a little ball bouncing on a pedestal. Cavaleiro [Horseman] is a distorted image that creates an illusion of tridimensionality from a determined point of view. By alluding with humor to the language of science, these objects reveal the narrative nature of science and philosophy in their attempts to understand the world.</p>

<p>The second room of the exhibition has been transformed into a large projection room with five short 16mm films. The sequences are shown in loop on a large screen. Three suns setting among stones, a blind man devouring a papaya, and geometricized fruits whirling in the air as though they were a planetary system. The noise of the projector – the films have no sound – is a permanent reminder of the materiality of the images.</p>

<p>SLATER BRADLEY - SHE WAS MY LA JETEE</p>

<p>Slater Bradley returns to Madrid to represent his latest work she was my la jeteé, a personal remake of the cult film La Jeteé (1962) by his idol Chris Marker, one of the best known experimental filmmakers of the 20th century.  In this work – filmed with Super 8 and HD, Bradley creates an idealised potrait of an unachievable woman. In addition, the exhibiton contains a series of photographs that represent the same archetypical pattern of an ideal woman as in La Jeteé.</p>

<p>Exhibition runs through to November 2nd, 2013</p>

<p>DARREN COFFIELD - ASHES AND DIAMONDS</p>

<p>Ashes and Diamonds, an art exhibition by acclaimed painter Darren Coffield
examining the minerʼs strike of the early 1980s.</p>

<p>Coffield is noted for his fine art portraiture, such as his painting of Nova magazine editor and 60s
scenester Molly Parkin that hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. But for Ashes and Diamonds Coffield has
employed urban art influences “to communicate with the grandchildren of the miners and their families.” As
a result the work is sometimes stark and uncompromising, simultaneously
echoing the sombre nature of populist agitant art during the 1980s.</p>

<p>Inspired by former Derbyshire miner John Dunn, Coffield has created many of the pieces on display using coal obtained from the National Union of Mineworkers branch at Maltby Colliery in South Yorkshire which was officially closed in April 2013. Some pieces feature incendiary motifs in a stencil art style including the word “scab” hanging from the gallows. A stirring poster evocative of mass entertainment posters, commemorates The Battle of Orgreave in which miners were attacked by police, "Work" is a study of a coal plant in a democratic style reflecting the personal attachment many miners had with their place of employment. The emotive subject matter of such works as "Clockwork Orgreave" has been of particular relevance recently given the inquiries into police brutality and cover-ups at events such as Orgreave and Hillsborough.</p>

<p>Exhibition runs through to August 31st, 2013</p>

<p>STEPHEN BALKENHOL</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 1980s as student of Ulrich Rückriem, Balkenhol experimented with minimalist form language. The first wooden heads and figurines emerged in 1982. At this time, many artists began returning to figuration. Sculptors like Katharina Fritsch, Thomas Schütte, Martin Honert and Jeff Koons developed strategies for a figuration, that reflected the new parameters of Minimal and Conceptual Art. The material unity of plinth and figurine, the open expressions and the indifferent postures are crucial aspects of Balkenhol’s works.</p>

<p>They demonstrate a reflection of Minimal Art: by abstaining from any expressivity, Balkenhol’s works advance from being representations of inner spaces and images to having presence in material and form in real space. In this regard Balkenhol’s archetypal sculptures are to a certain extent still tied to the „specific objects“ (Donald Judd).  
In 2012, the installation of one of Balkenhol’s sculptures in the tower of St. Elisabeth in Kassel caused great public interest. This year his monument for Richard Wagner in Leipzig was cause for a passionate debate. Balkenhol’s work that is prominently displayed in public spaces in many countries, has been subject of discussions for over 30 years. This show with new works is another opportunity to reflect or simply get enchanted by his concise as well as essential portrayals of people between everyday life, tradition and modernity.</p>

<p>JAKE &amp; DINOS CHAPMAN - THE SUM OF ALL EVIL</p>

<p>The Chapmans make work that examines cultural and historical stereotypes, using acerbic and surreal humour to question the status quo of hegemonic iconographies. They have described their practice as a way of establishing ‘how and whether we are allowed, or able, to show moral views’ and this exhibition addresses such subjects, challenging collective fears and anxieties through a selection of highly confrontational and culturally dislocating works.</p>

<p>Monumental in scope and minute in detail, 'The Sum of all Evil' (2012-13) occupies the entire ground floor of the gallery and is the most densely imagined diorama installation that the artists have produced to date. The fourth in a series of ‘Hell’ landscapes, the first and most well known of which, 'Hell'(1999), was destroyed in a warehouse fire, the work features a multitude of intricately modelled Nazi soldiers, along with various characters from the fast food chain McDonald's, committing violent, abhorrent acts set amid an apocalyptic landscape within four glass vitrines. Darkly humorous, 'The Sum of all Evil', as its title suggests, is imaginative rather than descriptive: a summation of all the worst possible 'evils', violence runs amok in a trans-historical and a-temporal arena.</p>

<p>The first floor gallery features four new diorama sculptures which expand on the themes from 'The Sum of all Evil'. In one vitrine, the instantly recognizable, bathetic character of Ronald McDonald is depicted as a melancholic fisherman on a crumbling jetty, his legs peacefully dangling over a lake thickly tangled with dead bodies. In another, a burnt out McDonald’s restaurant appears like a relic of contemporary consumerism, a ghostly reminder of its once ubiquitous global presence.</p>

<p>ANDY WARHOL &amp; TIM BESSELL - WARHOL SURF</p>

<p>Andy Warhol Surfboards by Tim Bessell Brings Warhol's movie "San Diego Surf" and his art together in perfect harmony. In October 2012, Andy Warhol's 1970's movie 'San Diego Surf' was released for the first time in New York City at the Museum of Modern Art. Timing couldn't be more perfect with the release of the first series of Warhol Bessell Surfboards hand crafted by Tim Bessell.</p>

<p>The first series of Warhol Bessell Surfboards consisted of 5 boards representing Warhol's art symbolically as it pertains to surfing.</p>

<p>To celebrate the release of the 2nd series, 5 more designs, we present an exhibition of all 10 boards. The Artist Series of all 10 Warhol Bessell Surfboards will be featured and for sale in this exhibition at Stolenspace.</p>

<p>Bessell's Artist Series surfboards pay homage to famous artists he's drawn inspiration from through the surfboards he's become renowned for. Released in very  limited editions, these handmade works were released in collaboration with the Warhol Foundation, taking Andy Warhol's graphics and combining them with his most popular surfboard shapes.</p>

<p>Exhibition runs from August 2nd to September 1st, 2013</p>

<p>CHRIS NEWMAN - A PILGRIMAGE IN MY OWN APARTMENT</p>

<p>Newman counts the words in Henrik Ibsen's drama ‘Ghosts' and has these numbers assigned to colours and colour combinations. Far from any idea of symbolism and psychology, the artist measures and makes his marks on the canvas with rational calculation and selects the respective colour palette as ‘created by Ibsen '. It is the result of a synthetic method that is only the means to an end. Through this, Newman rids himself of responsibility for his composition and consciously hands over the control.</p>

<p>The paintings are created in the limited space of his studio apartment. Newman takes a large distance from the canvas, in order to then reach out with the brush, several times, sometimes dancing. He paints with both hands. He does all of this blind, with closed eyes, but not to distance himself from the outside world but rather, as Newman says, to be ‘closer to the world' in order to lose ‘bourgeois control'. He works very quickly to remain unbiased and to undermine any control by means of self-observation. The process is a daily exercise for the artist, for his 'pilgrimage' as he himself has put it.</p>

<p>Each of his paintings depicts the repetitive experiment, the exact moment of finding the counterpoint that is necessary to create a painting on the canvas. It is exactly that amount that the process requires and it is no less that gives purpose to the method.</p>

<p>To find the beauty in Chris Newman's paintings, one does not need to know the background of his work. It is even less required to identify any potential remnants of narratives. It is a sense of body, a genuine unconscious and the dismissal of rational control that makes Newman's works so lively and filled with deeper beauty.</p>

<p>HUANG YUANQING, OUYANG CHUN &amp; SHI ZHIYING</p>

<p>A unique and leading figure of abstract art in China, Huang Yuanqing integrates Eastern and Western techniques and approaches to abstract painting.<br>Skilled as a calligrapher, Huang's paintings take a contemporary literati position, working from the traditional concept that painting and calligraphy stem from the same source. Guided by line, profuse layers of color and textures, Huang's intuitive language emerges slowly, appearing flexible and yet precise, guided by a rhythmic intelligence leading each resulting work. Contrary to the principles of calligraphy, however, Huang's paintings are created over a period of time, sometimes taking months or even years, suspending his process and output, and thus allowing time to play a critical and essential role in the completion of a finished work.</p>

<p>Ouyang Chun is well known for his subconscious investigations and diary-style narration. "Much of the time," the artist has stated, "I'm painting to explain myself, not simply to explain the painting process." Ouyang depicts urban and social life with a critical and sometimes mischievous eye. His paintings feel closer to outsider art, connected to folklore, and are often based on the idea of excess and accumulation. A network of images and objects fuse, seemingly random, but embody their own symbolic power, order, and universal significance. No image or object is taken for granted. Like many of the artists of his generation, he discarded political themes early in his development, seeking the greater potential in self-expression and personal psychology. The world of children, kings and queens, whales, mythological legends of the world and all who inhabit it, are central to Quyang's works that consciously avoid any definitive style, giving free rein to the inner world of the artist.</p>

<p>In contrast to the other two artists, Shi Zhiying is known for her stark black and white oil paintings of vast monochromatic vistas of the sea, endless landscapes of scattered rocks, traditional sand gardens, and intricate blades of grass. Shi's paintings are deeply visceral and contemplative, and summon intense reflection on individuality and the passage of time. The featured work in this exhibition is the painting The Infinite Lawn, which was the pivotal work in her solo exhibition at the Shanghai gallery last year. Shi will have her first solo exhibition at James Cohan Gallery in New York this month, where she will debut her latest body of work, The Relics, inspired by the artist's travels in China, Cambodia, and India</p>

<p>WILLIAM DANIELS</p>

<p>Daniels begins his artistic process by constructing aluminum foil maquettes of the figurative or abstract form that he plans to explore. The artist photographs reflections of light and color on the model, and then uses the resulting picture to inform his paintings, meticulously reproducing sections of the captured image in oil paint.</p>

<p>The arch is a structure with practical applications as well as myriad allegorical and romantic associations. Embodying grace and lightness, it symbolizes triumph, transition, and spiritual ascension. Daniels began exploring the arch as a subject in 2011, at first on the small scale characteristic of his earlier paintings. As his interest in the form developed, he began creating larger works in which he employs the arch as a repetitive motif, both within individual paintings and throughout his new body of work. These paintings, which pay homage to the structure, hover between realism and abstraction and illustrate Daniels’s rich style of painting.</p>

<p>SERGEJ JENSEN</p>

<p>Jensen employs a range of ready-made materials in lieu of canvas including wool, silk, linen, and burlap. His works often eschew painting altogether, relying instead on sewing, bleaching, or staining. When used, paint has been applied subtly, sparingly, and at times from behind the canvas. In more recent works, however, both undersaturated acrylic paint and soft pastel are applied liberally. Exotic materials including money, saffron, and diamond dust have also been known to adorn Jensen's surfaces.</p>

<p>Flaws in materials are embraced and even foregrounded in Jensen's paintings, drawing attention to seemingly incidental marks and signs of distress. A lack of expectation lends itself to an economy of means, in which leftover materials are often incorporated into new work as a gesture of self-reflexivity. While the canvas continually serves as a locus of deconstruction, in Jensen's new works the physical temperament of paint is further investigated. Utilizing a wide array of media and formal references, Jensen's paintings engage with an aesthetic of removal and withdrawal, while consistently bearing the traces of their making.</p>

<p>JOHN BALDESSARI</p>

<p>Exploring correspondences and disparities of image and culture as well as the hierarchy of man in these artworks, Baldessari emphasizes the distinct separateness of each photographic image and the composition of a work from incongruous and disparate fragments in space. “So much of our thinking is shaped by certain givens”, explains Baldessari.</p>

<p>“It is no accident that camera viewfinders are rectangles and that certain proportions shape our image of the world. I strongly believe that there is such a thing as hierarchy of vision that dominates the way that we picture reality. That is why for years my work has fought against what I term ‘the tyranny of the square.’ … ‘The use of frames as architecture is but an extension of the way I build my images up from psychologically charged material.’ (Baldessari in an article in Another Magazine by Mark Sanders, Autumn/Winter 2003).</p>

<p>JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT</p>

<p>Born to a Haitian father and a Puerto-Rican mother, Basquiat left his family home in Brooklyn, New York at the age of fifteen and took to the streets. A voracious autodidact, he quickly became a denizen of the explosive and decadent New York underground scene—a noise musician who loved jazz, and a street poet who scrawled his sophisticated aphorisms in Magic Marker across the walls of downtown Manhattan, copyrighting them under the name SAMO.</p>

<p>In 1981, he killed off this alter ego and began painting and drawing, first on salvaged materials then later on canvas and paper, and making bricolage with materials scavenged from the urban environment. From the outset he worked compulsively; his passion for words and music, his intense yet fluid energy, and the heterogeneous materials that he employed so freely imbued his work with urgency and excitement. He sold his first painting in 1981, and by 1982, spurred by the Neo-Expressionist art boom, his work was in great demand. In 1985, he was featured on the cover of The New York Times Magazine in connection with an article on the newly exuberant international art market. In that photograph, Basquiat is a vision of cool, sprawled in a chair in an elegant three-piece suit and tie, with bunched dreadlocks and bare feet, in front of a large, bold painting, a supernova in the making.</p>

<p>Charismatic image aside, Basquiat was a prodigious young talent, fusing drawing and painting with history and poetry to produce an unprecedented artistic language and content that bridged cultures and enunciated alternative histories. Combining materials and techniques with uninhibited yet knowing and precise intent, his paintings maintain a powerful tension between opposing aesthetic forces, expression and knowledge, control and spontaneity, savagery and wit, urbanity and primitivism, while providing acerbic commentary on the harsh realities of race, culture, and society.</p>

<p>FORMING THE LOSS IN DARKNESS</p>

<p>This is not a tribute.</p>

<p>In the 1988 silent super-8 film by David Wojnarowicz* titled Beautiful People, the black-and-white film turns into color at precisely the moment when its central and sole character, played by Jesse Hultberg, dressed in daytime drag, came into contact with an upstate New York lake in what appears to be a suicide attempt. Elation and death, held together and compressed into a singular graspable moment, uproots the previous state of consciousness. What have we been seeing when we watched him waking up, putting on makeup, hailing a cab in an escape from New York to the woods? What did he pack into his plastic box besides a framed image of Siamese twin skeletons?</p>

<p>Tracking the journey from slumber to death, for this exhibition, nine artists’ works set an alternative mise-en-scène of the rarely-screened film. The exhibition title is a reworking of the chapter “Losing the Form in Darkness” in Wojnarowicz’s book Close to the Knife: A Memoir of Disintegration (1991). To draw on the mundane history of the artist, telephone answering machine messages puncture the silence of the exhibition in the form of text and/or recording.</p>

<p>Each work in the exhibition lays open a different territory of Wojnarowicz’s video, but above all, as attempts to give form to something as fugitive as loss. Predominately abstract and concerned with the history of material as a form of narrativity, they embody a sense of life, of fate, of necessities. Fate with a sense of knowing that this might not be it, but it’s necessary.</p>

<p>MATHEW WEIR</p>

<p>In these works Weir continues to fuse imagery of ceramic figurines with his archive of landscapes to create complex narratives with exquisite yet melancholic auras. By dislocating and re-presenting historic objects such as early 19th Century German terracottas or Victorian ceramics in uncanny contexts, Weir entreats the viewer to reconsider how our interpretations of their original representations have been transposed over time and to actively address notions of racism, oppression, violence and death.</p>

<p>Two works from this exhibition, Jar (2011) and Bitter Fruit (2012) contrast the depiction of a black adolescent through a derisory colloquial object and the seemingly idyllic representation of a white woman: in the former, a rendition from a Victorian ceramic tobacco jar makes a visual parallel between boot-polishing and the original subject's skin, while in the latter the female figurine is dressed in elegant, pastoral drapes picking fruit for her basket as if in an Arcadian scene. The work's title, however, alludes to Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit, in particular her last line: 'Here is a strange and bitter crop'. This, together with the headscarf around the figure's neck, merges the violence of lynching with the Greek myth of Daphne becoming a tree.</p>

<p>Weir employs such layering of metaphor throughout his landscapes: an image of a waterfall referring to latent sexuality, a children's see-saw to the idea of psychological balance. And even in those works in this show where he has deliberately sliced his figurines apparently out of context so that they loom at you from solid black backgrounds, this ominous duality of interpretation is rife. Glory, Hallelujah (2013) is based on a detail of a Staffordshire figurine depicting the American abolitionist John Brown, who himself was hung for insurrection, its title from the famous Civil War marching song sung in his honour. The original figurine is cropped to an intimate portrait, which makes our encounter with Brown directly charged. His ardent but mis-painted eyes stare out from what's clearly a painting of a painted object, the quick, imprecise marks and cracks on the original mass-produced popular figurine contrasting with Weir's exacting brushwork. This vulnerable martyr not only epitomizes emancipation and release for Weir, but also fragile disfiguration.</p>

<p>DRISS OUADAHI - IMPLOSION</p>

<p>Throughout his artistic career, Driss Ouadahi has created special links between architecture and painting. The resulting works are abstract compositions featuring grid patterns, whose density evokes the architecture of the outskirts of big cities and their tightly woven networks of high-rise housing.</p>

<p>Moving around this organised, structured and tiered impression of the urban landscape, and in trying to capture its spirit and movement, Ouadahi creates a space with a hybrid language, blending structured drawing and painting, where the vibrations of light and chromatic richness constitute a break with the rigidity and monotony of the structures. Large brush-strokes give volume and depth to the repetitive geometry in highly colourful compositions, creating a surface which is at once attractive and impenetrable and which leaves us wondering about life behind these walls.</p>

<p>The inhabitants may not feature in these paintings, and yet they still reveal something of the social, townplanning and ethnic policies that are embodied in their mesh. Evoking architectural structures without their inhabitants means understanding the complexity of a place that can never be reduced only to what it is in itself. The composition of Ouadahi's works, abiding by a poetry of architectural codes, transforms the visible into a metaphor tending to point out an invisible driving force behind that which we see. The power of the visible depends, then, on its ability to suggest the invisible, and in this way Driss Ouadahi uses architecture as an abstract visual context where he constructs our way of seeing.</p>

<p>ANDREAS RÜTHI</p>

<p>Rüthi works directly from observation, creating complex formal compositions that bring together a variety of interests, with art historical references, found objects and his personal history all occupying equal importance and value of meaning. This exhibition can be seen to show the development of Rüthi's distinct painterly style with new paintings made during the last four years, split into two series, the book paintings and the more recent Morandiesque still life paintings.</p>

<p>The title of the exhibition, 'Home Is Where The Art Is', refers not only to the making of his work and the ways in which his immediate environment influences his painting practice, but to the space and activities associated with domesticity and comfort. His studio is in a former slaughterhouse at the end of his garden and this sense of the uncanny or familiarity goes some way to suggest that the artist has thought about the dissonance between connotations of home. Notions of 'home' can of course point towards feminine domains, romantic clichés, cosy familial idylls, and yet persuade us to consider our trust in boundaries from the outside world created only by sand and water, bricks and mortar; a most unsettling reality. At its most basic level, the home is both a potential site of conflict and often of conflicting subjectivities or even ideologies. Though it can be a place where one might feel safe, find refuge, a place of belonging and community, it also holds the possibility of antagonism rather than harmony.</p>

<p>This analogy between the home and the studio clearly resonates strongly with Rüthi. With his pared down methodology – a toy, a book, a piece of fruit, a postcard, a pot, accessory, perfume bottle, shelf or tabletop – his paintings could have been made anywhere: in an unfurnished room devoid of comfort, perhaps a prison cell. The high drama of the everyday is material for the artist: it's endlessly repeatable, an altar set up by a recidivist, a serial offender who paints the shadows between things.</p>

<p>LUCIA LAGUNA - JARDIM</p>

<p>Lucia Laguna's painting portrays her surroundings: the landscape of suburban Rio de Janeiro, the district's informal architecture, the artist's own studio and the garden of her house. They are slices of the landscape presented in a veiled, nearly abstract way. Shapes, lines and color fields are overlaid with more figurative elements, often giving the impression of a broken mirror.</p>

<p>Laguna has developed a unique method, in which images are produced in acrylic paint by her assistants, according to her guidelines, who then completes or deconstructs them using oil paint. They are compositions where it seems that the process of painting never ends, the images remains alive and changeable before our eyes. The painting arises not only from observation, but also from an empirical practice of juxtaposition and reprocessing of everyday images, generating an accumulation of memories.</p>

<p>The garden of Lucia's canvases is urban and characteristic of Rio de Janeiro. It shows itself amid a mix of stones and vases, the hills are taken by houses, and the backyards are full of rubble. In Jardim nº 11, for example, we see only a little table with houses in the background, there is no green on the canvas. The artist leaves large areas covered by patches of paint in colors ranging from beige to yellow, giving the impression of a field yet to be filled. It is an invitation for the spectator to project his/her own images on the accumulation of memories preserved under the mass of color.</p>

<p>LOS CARPINTEROS - BOLA DE PELO</p>

<p>Upon entering the gallery, one encounters forty metal sculptures that seem to cover the floor of the first gallery space. Clavos Torcidos [Twisted Nails] (2013) is an installation comprised of large-format nails (approx. 150 – 200 cm, each). Seemingly twisted and rusty the nails look like they have been extracted from their former purpose and discarded. The motif of "Failure" comes to mind. Bent out of shape, the nails have lost their purpose, when in reality the sculptures have been carefully crafted. Here, the ordinary becomes extraordinary. The different contours drawn by Clavos Torcidos resemble lying bodies, which are sleeping in different positions or the falled men after combat – in both cases the work discusses on the human shape and its suffering. This physicality finds an echo in the second gallery space, where the video work Pellejo is shown.</p>

<p>DONALD JUDD</p>

<p>From the early 1960s up until the time of his death, Judd developed a rigorous visual vocabulary that sought clear and definite objects as its primary mode of articulation. Together, the works in this exhibition present an overview of many of Judd’s signature forms and offer insight into his singular commitment to material, color, and proportion. One of the most significant American artists of the postwar period, Judd’s oeuvre has come to define what has been referred to as Minimalist art, a label to which the artist strongly objected on the grounds of its generality.</p>

<p>CHARLES AVERY - IT MEANS IT MEANS!</p>

<p>‘It Means It Means!’ circumvents almost all of the usual processes and paraphernalia of exhibition making. This ‘drawn show’ does not demand loan agreements, shipping contractors, or teams of toiling technicians - all that is 
necessary to its creation is a list of works, supplied by the curator Tom Morton, 
and Charles Avery’s efforts at the drawing board. If freedom from budgetary 
constraints means that the exhibition might conceivably contain any artwork from 
anywhere in the ‘real’ world (compare the costs of transporting, say, a large 
bronze sculpture across an ocean to depicting it in pencil on paper), the fact 
that it is staged in a fictional museum, in the capital city of a fictional territory, 
gives rise to further freedoms, perhaps among them the suspension of certain 
curatorial orthodoxies.</p>

<p>The exhibition’s title offers a response to a question often asked of unfamiliar 
artworks: ‘But what does it mean?’ To state that ‘It Means It Means!’ is to point 
to art’s primary property, the fact that it ‘means’ before it ‘denotes X’ or ‘connotes Y’. Perhaps it is only when works from our own world travel to another that this property comes into focus. ‘It Means It Means!’ is, after all, a showcase 
of exotica, of foreign art made after a very foreign Enlightenment. We may ask 
whether the Islanders understand these works as we do, or whether they take 
them in a very different spirit? And what is shown at Onomatopoeia’s Museum 
when it is not playing host to art produced far from the Island’s shores?</p>

<p>KAI RICHTER - BREAK THROUGH THE LINES</p>

<p>Kai Richter's sculptures not only transform raw materials from the construction industry into works of art but also, and primarily, the space that surrounds them. In the truest sense of the word, his works "capture the space" since his construction-material installations not only occupy the space with their momentum and dynamics but also literally reach in and make the space real to the observer. As you can see, the sculptor is interested in creating a way to make a so-called dialog between the sculpture itself and the surrounding space in which it can unfold. The result is a symbiosis – a sort of "give and take" since the one defines the other and both claim their right to exist, at least for the limited duration of the artistic intervention.</p>

<p>Even though Richter's large-format, space-related works literally take over the space and assert themselves very strongly there, they point out the stories of the space with self-assured authority and are not provocative. Strongly reduced in form and color, areas and volumes are what count here.</p>

<p>Richter's installations, objects and photo-collages are not just the mere paraphrasing of architecture or construction sites. They themselves are neither architecture nor architectural by products nor only mere reproductions of architecture. Instead they exist next to or within the architecture as commentary, theses or even prognoses.</p>

<p>ANDREA MEDJESI-JONES - VENTRILOQUIST</p>

<p>Andrea Medjesi-Jones’ recent paintings reveal both a highly personal project and a re-investigation of, or reinvestment in, the actual means of painting and its broader cultural ramifications. Works such as No More or Work or Riot show a concern with articulating, through the process itself, surface and depth, gesture, provisional structures, interruptions, breakages, and systems of flow and stoppage. In No More a loose set of floating blocks as a set of open framing devices; these act as an accompaniment to a set of circulating black gestures sometimes dense, congealing into a think uncontained ooze, while at other times petering out into a rubbed trace.</p>

<p>The relationship between brushed gestures, rollered marks, traced imprints, masking, and staining create a porous surface that breathes in different registers. This stop-go of temporal layers creates a sense of evolution, which none-the-less never quite resolves completely. Work or Riot is another example of this almost impossible balancing act of disturbed histories and organic flow; the anarchic carnivalesque celebration of these works is shadowed by something much darker (as might also be seen in the painting Public Image: a kind of sullied, dirtied Matissean Jazz). With its slogan-like text Work or Riot operates like a poster or an announcement, perhaps also suggesting the propagandistic aspect of all images including the vast image bank of painting.</p>

<p>BEN GRASSO</p>

<p>Grasso continues his dedicated study of the unsettled interplay between the destructive forces of nature and architecture, and, for the first time, examines interior spaces and their connection with the outside world.</p>

<p>Perhaps because of Grasso’s prolonged study of the fragility of dwellings and their uneasy union with the phenomena of the physical world, a subtlety exists with these new works, which sees the artist in lockstep with his subject matter and beginning a shift to - dare we say - a more harmonious existence between humanity and nature. This may be a false sense of security however due to his palette of congruous and complementary colors that glow from within or explode with great force, while remaining a visual feast.</p>

<p>Grasso does not have a set agenda with his creations and invites the viewer to become a participant in the process, filling in gaps and making their own narrative. One thing is clear; Grasso’s focus on foliage further blurs the line between the chaos and order often present in his work. Several of his canvases feature houses floating in the sky, lifted up by a momentous gust of wind where they hover like alien spaceships in precarious treetops. For the first time, we see what this disruption looks like from the inside out, as orange and yellow brushstrokes bring to mind a fireball of destruction, as much as they do leaves and the autumn season. The outside realm becomes part of the inside space, resulting in a claustrophobic atmosphere where flames or fauna encroach and engulf.</p>

<p>JAN-HENRI BOOYENS</p>

<p>Booyens' work is often described in terms of a struggle between the representational and abstract, the rational and chaotic. An affinity and critical engagement with Modernism is coupled with his relationship to the South African landscape, both social and physical.</p>

<p>For his latest work, Booyens has affected subtle iconographic shift from forms that allude of the art historical 'landscape' to those of the 'still life'. Booyens’s flower like-forms explode in abstract compositions and assemblages of studio detritus, where form and colour fracture and falter in 70s impasto kitch, Stella stripes, colour supernovas and jpeg disintegration.</p>

<p>WILHELM SASNAL</p>

<p>Sasnal’s artistic practice creates an archive from the sprawling mass of images that flood contemporary society. His source material is taken from newspapers, magazines, films, the Internet, billboards, his immediate surroundings in Poland and his many travels. This vast diversity of motifs goes hand in hand with Sasnal’s sampling of different painting styles from the 20th century, whether Geometric Abstraction, Tachism, Photorealism or Pop Art.</p>

<p>In his new paintings, Sasnal explores the sensation of losing control through two seemingly disparate subjects: wounded motorcyclists lying on a racetrack after a wreck, and outer space. Using a muted palette of gray, blue and black, he presents the moment when space becomes apparent, both in the physical sense of falling to the ground, as in the paintings of the motorcyclists, and in the more abstract sense of the great emptiness of the universe, as in his paintings of solar systems and space.</p>

<p>JAMES HOLDSWORTH  - LOVE ME TENDER</p>

<p>This new body of work is about James' reflection on the Great Masters and their masterpieces, classical and contemporary artists as seen from a 21st century perspective, reinvention, 
transcription, iconic references and influences.  Life today as a painter.<br>
James graduated in 1977 and set up a printing business under the name of 'Little James' in the the heart of Chelsea, printing provocative T shirts, posters and canvasses.  This project continued until the early 1980’s, when everything changed once again, with the arrival of hip-hop and new wave on the London scene.</p>

<p>James seeing an opportunity, turned his hand to the art of flyers and club promotion, and began a now legendary residency at Crazy Larry's on the Kings Road, seeing in the new wave rave revolution until the beginning of the 1990’s, when he left the Kings Road for New York City.
A period of Rock n Roll, Hall of Fame and the Bowry C.B.G.B’s ensued, with commissions and exhibitions slotted in throughout, and then a return to London for the new millennium.</p>

<p>ROBERT DEL NAJA - FIRE SALE</p>

<p>Fire Sale will be a unique retrospective of painting and design that have helped define Massive Attack over the past 20 years, covering the pages of sketchbooks to 12 million record sleeves.<br>
 Previously unseen pieces created for Massive Attack's latest album Heligoland (2010) will be exhibited alongside archival works painted and screen printed for the first time from 1991's Blue Lines and 1994's Protection.</p>

<p>Robert's ongoing collaboration with UVA with whom he designed Massive Attack's hugely influential live shows are represented in digital mirror pieces.</p>

<p>Fire Sale will be the first and only time these pieces will be collected in one place: images have been hand-finished and are total one-offs - unseen images alongside those more familiar - enhanced and redacted especially for this show.</p>

<p>Under the tag 3D, Robert was a central figure in the Bristolian graffiti movement that would eventually spawn Banksy. Like his music, 3D's art is modern and grounded, challenging and beautiful, industrial and ethnic. A vocal critic of the Iraq war, the conscious elements of the pieces are a reminder that Massive Attack have always been outspoken on social and international issues.</p>

<p>HANS-PETER FELDMANN</p>

<p>The focus of the exhibition is put on pictures stemming from different sources, mainly 19th and early 20th century paintings. In his Dreiergruppen (triads) Feldmann arranges three images of different traditional subject-matters and techniques.</p>

<p>Each viewer may perceive and interpret these constellations in his or her own way. Thus images of clearly defined theme and content are integrated in a network of open and complex relationships. Feldmann continuously ties his work to the history of image production and its entire cultural spectrum, from fine art to mass production, from children’s books to photography and postcards. He is interested in which images are popular, held in esteem and collected by people at any given time. By way of painterly interventions he creates a new, contemporary context: red noses, crossed eyes and black eyes add a strikingly modern and humorous accent to the dusty and solemn images. Feldmann brings the stiff and conventional portraits back to life. </p>

<p>Exhibition runs through to June 22nd, 2013</p>

<p>JOSEPH KOSUTH - INSOMNIA: ASSORTED, ILLUMINATED</p>

<p>Featuring work dating from 1965 through to today, 'Insomnia: assorted, illuminated, fixed .' will for the first time offer an extensive overview of the artist’s work in neon. This chronicals a nearly 50
year-long investigation of the production and role of language and meaning within art, and an on-going use of neon, a material appropriated in the 1960’s first by Kosuth who considered it a form of ‘public writing’, without fine art associations, and traditionally associated with popular culture.</p>

<p>The exhibition will feature 26 of Kosuth’s neon works, showcasing key early compositions including one of the artist’s first neons Five Fives (to Donald Judd) [orange], (1965), alongside recent works such as elements from his Beckett series (2011). Constructed in a way that actively responds to the gallery’s specific architectural space, the colourful retrospective will be installed across the length of the top floor of the gallery, utilising some never before used areas for display purposes.</p>

<p>An important pioneer of Conceptual Art, Kosuth is credited with initiating appropriation
strategies, language based works and the use of photography in the 1960’s. The artist’s
investigations into language and perception, and the appropriated use of literature,
philosophy as well as psychology characteristically take the form of works in series, a practice
that allows capacity for play and reflexivity in direction.</p>

<p>PHILIP TAAFFE</p>

<p>Taaffe’s work is a unique technical amalgam of freely gestural painting that is often contrasted with carefully mapped and measured surfaces, combined with printings from linocuts, hand-drawn relief plates, silkscreens, and stencils. Traditional techniques, such as paper marbling and gold leaf, are often employed. The artist’s meticulous, labor-intensive methods have often been compared to that of medieval manuscripts, yet their contemporary veracity is always evident in their broad embrace and appropriation of the language of modernism. As art historian Charles Stein notes, “Taaffe’s reinvention of the beautiful represents a kind of valiant inquiry, a conscientious refusal of the suppression of human possibility.”</p>

<p>In this current body of work, Taaffe returns to some of his familiar tropes but employs them in new, previously unseen ways. Sources include natural history illustrations, Roman mosaics, microscopic imaging of Viking artifacts, Syrian embroidery pattern books, masks from Mongolia and the Far East, and devices drawn from calligraphy and book design. Optical vibrancy and visual energy underlie these images, reconnecting abstraction to the natural world and exploring the convergence of the optical and conceptual. “I think the power and possibilities for painting today has to do with binding it to a cultural legacy,” says Taaffe. “Painting is where these symbolic languages or forms somehow crystallize and reveal their ancestry and that in turn shows a certain sense of future possibility.”</p>

<p>TED LAWSON - CRUDE</p>

<p>Ted Lawson’s body of work develops a multi-layered system of sculptural meanings that treats all of his subjects and objects as visual language, by connecting them in an evocative way. In an interview, Lawson declared that he is concerned with portraiture in sculpture “as a range of physical possibilities, rather than as a frozen moment in time.” The elastic notion of time and the ways in which it affects the viewer, physically and emotionally, resides at the core of this artist’s creative imagination.</p>

<p>CRUDE will feature the latest creations of the artist, inaugurating a black series of works, whose size and setting place them at the border between sculpture and installation. The title alludes to basic elements and primary materials, such as black crude oil before it is refined.</p>

<p>One of the pieces, all in black, shows a life-size female figure levitating, defying gravity and simultaneously dissolving. The black color can operate as a symbol of death or simply as a base material; the crude energy which we all derive from. The female body is accompanied by small star-shaped solids - representing the realm of the underlying, yet unseen structures of the universe, creating a surreal atmosphere. Other found objects: a crushed acetone can, a piece of broken pipe, and human bones are integrated in the work, signifying the process of discarding; it is about “what we discard - in our mind, in our life, including ourselves”, confesses the artist.</p>

<p>D*FACE - NEW WORLD DISORDER</p>

<p>Stockton has been at the forefront of popular culture not only as an acclaimed wall painter and artist, but also as a respected, internationally-recognised gallerist at StolenSpace. Since its humble beginnings in 2007, he has transformed the local area of Brick Lane in to a thriving hub for street art.<br>
With galleries representing his work in London, New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo and Melbourne, D*Face re-works popular imagery from advertising and comic books, commenting on the corruptive nature of fame, celebrity and our consumerist society.</p>

<p>The exhibition includes his latest body of work, which reflectsupon times of chaos, disorder and loss, as informed by shifting circumstances in the social climate. Exploring topical and long standing dystopian sentiments, New World Disorder confronts the effects of love and loss from a physical, mental and cultural standpoint, drawing up on the artist's direct experiences.</p>

<p>Elements of the show are inspired by The Tillman Story,the 2010 documentary film about the 2004 death of U.S. Army Ranger Pat Tillman in the war in Afghanistan, the cover-up of the true circumstances of his death, and his family's struggle to unearth the truth.</p>

<p>SCOTT CAMPBELL - THINGS GET BETTER</p>

<p>Campbell’s new work consists of a series of ink wash paintings on paper that realistically illustrate novel objects and improvised tools. The subject matter of these detailed watercolors explore notions of invention and reinvention, or more accurately, human ingenuity.</p>

<p>While working on a project in Mexico City several years ago, which involved documenting aspects of prison tattoo culture, Campbell discovered an array of devices, imaginatively pieced together by inmates. Using a motley combination of items, they had recreated specific mechanisms by appropriating materials that were readily accessible, such as electric razors, guitar strings, and toothbrushes. These reinventions replaced equipment otherwise unavailable to them, exemplifying perseverance over restrictions.</p>

<p>Motivated by this experience – how limitations can engender creative thinking – Campbell conceived his own adaptations of similar mark-making instruments, depicted in this series of paintings. Rather than fabricating “tools” for practical use, he arranged them as studies, imaging ingenuity as an art form. In doing so, this work synthesizes artistic method and invention, visually conveying the science of problem solving as an aesthetic process. Through his plain use of black ink, along with a definitively applied brush technique, Campbell creates work that accurately reproduces his subjects, while also capturing its true essence. This laborious and unforgiving artistic practice requires focus – once a stroke is painted, it cannot not be changed, hidden, or erased.</p>

<p>JAC LEIRNER - HARDWARE SILK</p>

<p>The title 'Hardware Silk' derives from Leirner's obsessive accumulation of ordinary 'found' objects and ready-mades that become materials for her art. Specialist nautical ropes, colourful climbing clips, chains, steel cabling, domestic curtain rings or precision instruments such as spirit levels and rulers, are all items that Leirner uses and objectifies in her interventions and reconstructions. Leirner adopts a formal rigour and aesthetic to the way she collects, arranges and assembles, evident in this exhibition, which includes sculptural wall reliefs, a group of watercolours and a single, 19 metre-long installation that divides the lower-ground floor gallery.</p>

<p>In Portuguese, cigarette rolling papers are called 'papeis de seda' which translates into English as 'silk papers'. Leirner has been an avid smoker for most of her life and through this habit, has come into contact with the various types, colours and formats of these papers. She subsequently became fascinated with the minimal and insubstantial nature of this material for the same reasons that she adopted the incidental ephemera of the museum world - its artwork labels and business cards - in previous work. In the lower-ground floor gallery, Leirner has gummed single Rizla papers directly on to the wall in row upon row to form grids, creating a diaphanous monochrome or minimalist painting that flutters and transforms as the viewer walks past. Titled 'Skin' (2013), the installation references both the habitual, repetitive activity of rolling papers and the physical, tangible nature of this material: a delicate and translucent syphon used to smoke tobacco and pot.</p>

<p>DANIEL GORDON - THE GREEN LINE</p>

<p>The exhibition title is a nod to Matisse’s well-known 1905 portrait of the artist’s wife and is visually referenced in several of Gordon’s works including large scale still lifes and portraits, along with a selection of smaller works operating as isolated studies. In conjunction with the exhibition.</p>

<p>In Gordon’s practice, the artist culls photographic images from the Internet, prints them out and uses them to build three-dimensional tableaus. He then photographs these tableaus with an 8 x 10 inch view camera. Afterward, the sculptures are dismantled, though their various elements body parts, colors, background patterns—are often reused to make new works.</p>

<p>Gordon's melding together of fragmented parts form a dislocated reality where different perspectives, profiles and people merge into an incongruous whole. Through the process of slicing, cutting, gluing, staging, arranging and recycling, Gordon executes a shift from digital to analogue, almost as though he were engaged in a physical form of Photoshop and challenges the stability of the fixed image, opening up the possibility for new meanings to emerge. This unique handling of the photographic medium connects Gordon with the history of collage and painting. In these works red, yellow and blue dominate in bold blocks. Visibly torn edges, gobs of glue and raw, recycled scraps fuse and separate before our eyes, wavering between completion and dissolution.</p>

<p>JULIE MEHRETU - LIMINAL SQUARED</p>

<p>This exhibition, which features five new works, centres around ‘Mogamma: A Painting in Four Parts’, the collective name for four monumental canvases that were recently included in dOCUMENTA (13). The ‘Mogamma’ works, which were completed in 2012 shortly after the time of the Arab Spring revolutions, have evolved out of Mehretu's investigations into how architecture and geographical space, particularly within urban centres, become sites for political and mythological projection. ‘I think architecture reflects the machinations of politics, and that's why I am interested in it as a metaphor for those institutions. I don't think of architectural language as just a metaphor about space, but about spaces of power, about ideas of power’, Mehretu explains.</p>

<p>The title of these works relates to 'Al-Mogamma', the name of the all purpose government building in Tahrir Square, Cairo which was both instrumental in the 2011 revolution and architecturally symptomatic of Egypt's post-colonial past. The word 'Mogamma', however, means 'collective' in Arabic and historically, has been used to refer to a place that shares a mosque, a synagogue and a church and is a place of multi faith.</p>

<p>In the ‘Mogamma’ paintings, Mehretu has overlaid hundreds of images taken from different squares around the globe – symbolically weighted urban centres that have become nexus points for upheaval and revolution – and combined them with single blocks, lines and arcs of bold acrylic colour. The works, which contain a complex web of mark making and visual narrative, point to a reading of the built environment in our post-colonial condition, where the language and motifs of architecture always contain the metaphors for its own entropy and the fractured history of past conflict.</p>

<p>PETER MCDONALD</p>

<p>Peter McDonald examines every intricate aspect of human behaviour in his painting. Pole vaulters, doughnuts, the cosmos, moon boot factories, ninjas, stretch limos, jungles, auctioneers, hairdressers, funeral processions, submarines, dog walking, museums, snooker players and cave painters. Nothing is immune to being McDonaldized in his exploration of the infinite nature of painting. Like a psychedelic Audubon or Dr. Johnson, he is gradually compiling an endless encyclopaedia of images.</p>

<p>Peter McDonald’s fourth solo exhibition at Kate MacGarry includes an eight metre long scroll painting, a mobile and seven new paintings. McDonald has created a mobile with each object a freeform, flat sculpture with pictures painted on both sides. This kinetic sculptural form, originated by Calder, allows different images to juxtapose themselves with each other, giving the viewer a kaleidoscopic experience of McDonald’s pictorial universe. This form moves painting away from the static, four walled canvas, and is closer to a diorama or picture book, where the viewer responds to and interacts with the images. Here, the mobile is its own unique collection of pictures in one object, akin to Duchamp’s Boîte-en-Valise or Warhol's Big Retrospective Painting.</p>

<p>MENTORING COURTNEY LOVE</p>

<p>The concept of mentoring is one not often associated with the contemporary art world. Yet artist Courtney Love, best known as a musician, credits artist and photographer David LaChapelle with mentoring her as a visual artist. Love's work, featured in this exhibition, are all works on paper.</p>

<p>They are executed in a combination of pastel, watercolor, graphite, colored pencil, charcoal, acrylic, and marker. The works on view are all portraits, including some self-portraits, and this is where we see the relationship between her work and that of her mentor David LaChapelle. While LaChapelle's photographic portraits are slick and hyper-real, Love's portraits are sketch-like and spontaneous. Her images are raw and full of emotion, and they bear a resemblance to her music. There is a consistency in vision between her music and her visual art that suggests an authenticity of expression.</p>

<p>RICHARD WOODS - D.I.Y.</p>

<p>The work of Richard Woods traverses the boundaries between art, architecture and design in an on-going examination of the relationship between the functional and the ornamental. The everyday surfaces that surround us provide the canvas onto which the artist transposes elements from the vernacular of traditional urban design. His architectural interventions toy with perception and reality, manipulating and transforming the facades and interiors of existing structures through the application of synthetic fronts or 'logos': galleries become mock-Tudor houses, City Hall security booths red brick-castles, and cloistered Venetian courtyards crazy-paved suburban patios. His simplified, stylised facades poke fun at our aesthetic values, both mocking and paying homage to the cult of renovation and DIY. His distilled encasements impose new values on the buildings they occupy, contrasting the urban with the rural, the old with the new, and the congested with the minimal. Each installation challenges us to confront the way in which we construct our surroundings, and probes the irrevocable artificiality of our local environment.</p>

<p>Woods' site-specific installation at the Alan Cristea Gallery will comprise interior floor and wall coverings in his trademark vibrantly-coloured and exaggerated wood-grain motif. Deceptively simple in form, these bold images are produced using traditional block-printing techniques and installed as parquetry (inlaying wood in geometric patterns). Pre-occupied with the notion of reproduction, the techniques employed by Woods allude to historical artisanal processes, the power of iconography and the dominance of consumerist plasticity. As is the case with much of Woods' work, the method of construction is appropriate to the surface he is mimicking, articulating the similarities between the artist's methodology and materials, and those used in everyday situations.</p>

<p>KOEN VAN DEN BROEK - APEX</p>

<p>In this body of large-scale work van den Broek uses the history of his own paintings as a reference point and conceives fresh commentaries on abstraction. He formally resolves his signature tension between the photographic and the painterly, transcending from referential and cerebral to the experiential and spiritual.</p>

<p>A trained architect, van den Broek uses light, shape, and repetition to build generic structures, be it natural or man-made, through layering and the application of vibrant colors. Shadows cast by anonymous buildings, cracks in sun baked pavement, and lonely overpass bridges suggest human presence and a narrative long past. His preference for the casual and reflective aligns with Edward Hopper and Wayne Thiebaud.</p>

<p>Known for employing photographic images taken on road trips as the basis for his work - from Belgium to Tokyo, Chicago, Los Angeles and beyond, with this new series van den Broek abandons this alibi, and with it, the inherent distancing and melancholic effects. Instead, he samples the 20th and 21st century, as seen through his own eyes, invoking Abstract Expressionism in the vein of Clyfford Still infused with the self-conscious and self-referential characteristics of American Conceptualism.</p>

<p>ESTUARY</p>

<p>Estuary brings together the work of 12 artists who have been inspired by the outer limits of the Thames where the river becomes the sea. The exhibition marks the 10th anniversary of the Museum of London Docklands, a converted Georgian warehouse on West India Quay.</p>

<p>With its dramatic landscape – desolate mudflats and saltmarshes, vast open skies, container ports, power stations and seaside resorts – the Estuary has long been a rich source of inspiration for artists and writers. Through film, photography, painting and printmaking, the contemporary artists featured in this exhibition offer new insight into this often overlooked, yet utterly compelling, environment and the people that live and work there.</p>

<p>Exhibition runs from May 17th to October 27th, 2013</p>

<p>KENNY SCHARF - KOLORS</p>

<p>Inspired by Color Field masterworks, deceptively present themselves as backdrops for the sculptures. Upon closer inspection, the tonally unified paintings beckon the viewer into vibrant, other-worldly, biomorphic atmospheres composed of a variety of shapes, dimensions and details. The three never-before-seen sculptures revisit the classic icons of Scharf’s repertoire of symbolic imagery developed over thirty years. Scharf’s exhibition possesses a unique energy and exuberance, highlighted by both his cosmic paintings and nostalgic sculptures. A fully illustrated catalogue, published in collaboration with Standard Press and Damiani, will accompany the exhibition and be available for purchase at the PK SHOP and The Standard Shop at The Standard, High Line ($40).</p>

<p>Scharf’s use of airbrush-like oil and acrylic paint embodies the influence of street culture within contemporary art practices that he helped establish.   Scharf’s inspiration stems from the past, the future, nature, and the cosmic world of inner and outer space.  In his sculptures, Scharf makes use of his iconic imagery, freezing expressive cartoon-like faces in curvilinear three-dimensional reflective forms. Scharf presents larger-than-life versions of three seminal characters from his pantheon of cartoon-like creatures. Two sculptures, Squirtz and Red Scary Guy, present an embodiment of anger and happiness; whereas Totemotiki climbs twelve feet to the ceiling, stacking characters that showcase the duality and interconnectedness of human emotions.</p>

<p>MICHAEL SIMPSON - THE LEPER SQUINT PAINTINGS</p>

<p>The Leper Squint is an architectural feature of medieval churches in which an opening in the outer wall, often at an oblique angle, allowed lepers and other undesirables to observe the service while entirely avoiding contact with the congregation. The Leper Squint substantiates the absurd anomaly of Christian belief that leprosy was a punishment from God. These slits are a form of hypocrisy literally built into the foundations of the religion: those who need the church's charity the most are the ones kept outside.</p>

<p>Simpson paints his subject square and frontally, providing a piece of furniture as an aid to reach the squint. The furniture, a step-stool or ladder, say, invites the viewer into the space of the painting. While Simpson’s Bench Paintings faced outwards, with the benches' backs towards the viewer, these new works are internalised: the squint looks into the space of the painting, a space we will never see. The viewer is held in an antechamber, denied view, waiting.</p>

<p>The historical and architectural device of the squint has allowed Simpson to make a philosophical series of paintings about looking, about what exists and where we exist in relation to it. What is through the squint? The afterlife, death, the void, paradise, truth? The tone of the paintings is somber and atmospheric. They put us in a timeless space with no sense of location. Simpson provides us with a Beckettian space from which to consider questions of morality, art and mortality.</p>

<p>JOSHUA MARSH - AS IF</p>

<p>Strong color and the play of light dominate Marsh’s paintings, slowly revealing simple objects. Color functions as form, while objects and their surroundings border on dissolution.</p>

<p>Pitchers, tables, dustpans and brooms serve as subjects, but it is through their shapes, shadows and changing perspectives that Marsh pushes them into altogether different realms. The curves of pitchers suggest bodies; the interplay of other objects evokes openings and closings, solids and voids. Distinctions between what is observed and imagined break down, and being and appearance are as if equals.</p>

<p>Marsh may begin his paintings by observing an object, creating an invented form, or exploring the relationship between three and four colors. There is an obsession with the painted surface and with the evolution of each image. Ultimately, resolutions between painterly impulses and perceptual logic determine the final outcomes.</p>

<p>JUDY GLANTZMAN</p>

<p>This most recent body of work comes after seeing Pablo Picasso’s Guernica, which she visited for the first time three years ago. As a result, Glantzman’s work began to shift away from her typical introspective self-portraits toward a more encompassing, outward exploration of war and its societal impact.</p>

<p>In a statement on the new work, Glantzman states:</p>

<p>“All of my work is like a flashlight on the dark underbelly that exists under the surface of polite society.  The United States is engaged in wars without any impact on our daily life.  My work always had the macabre, and I wanted to marinate in my natural impulse, no holds barred.  I felt that I understood the language of the psychological self-portrait and I wanted to try to invent a new language for myself.”</p>

<p>The individual images interact with each other exposing the horrors and diversity of war. She continues:</p>

<p>“I approached the work with collage. What did one image look like next to an entirely different image: one might be made from observation- an image of something that symbolized war and death- a skull, other bones, guns. I tried, in a series of small canvas mounted with paper, various motifs like a mourner over a coffin.  The hope was that, in combination, the pieces would yield greater meaning than the individual parts, that, as an artist, I was creating the stage with room for the viewer to locate his/her own associations.”</p>

<p>ESTHER STOCKER</p>

<p>Esther Stocker’s modernist form language manifests itself in a variety of artistic media, addressing a theme that dates back to the abstraction of painting in the early 20th century, when Kasimir Malevich’s Black Square on White (1915) transferred painting to the non-representational realm and introduced a spatial dimension. The departure of painting towards a three-dimensional approach that goes beyond figurative representation created a wider range of possibilities to view art as a holistic experience of philosophical issues.</p>

<p>In her works, Stocker uses diverse media to address the resumption of a Malevichian discourse on abstraction geared to the theory of space. The artist systematically checks the validity of the two-dimensional logic of imagination in painting and breaks up its spatial limitations. By using black-and-white patterns and textures, she releases the viewer from the perception of colour and draws their attention directly to spatial structures. Stocker’s artistic work deals with the juxtaposition of painting, photography and sculpture as an interaction between theories that encompass all spatial dimensions.</p>

<p>In her most recent works, black squares in grid patterns are transferred in a repetitive form onto the surface of objects that are suspended in space. By folding and creasing the original paintings on paper, she creates “clusters” or reliefs on the wall. The process of creasing the black-and-white grid patterns creates a distorted array of variously arranged squares, thus also alluding to instances of Op Art and subsequently transferring them into the three-dimensionality of space.</p>

<p>NATHAN MABRY - SHAPESHIFTER</p>

<p>Mabry’s Heavy Handed (Separation Anxiety) and Heavy Handed (Tocca Ferro/Horns Up) will be presented in gallery two. The Heavy Handed works are large-scale sculptures made of steel that resemble block-like human hands, making gestures ranging from the benign to the profane. They reference sign language, colloquial symbols and other forms of gestural communication that can be simultaneously illustrative and provocative.</p>

<p>In gallery three, Mabry will exhibit his newest series of work, which comprises oversized terra-cotta heads resting atop aluminum bases that reference minimalist sculpture, specifically Donald Judd’s milled aluminum works. The heads, hand-sculpted by Mabry, are derived from architectural elements - tenon heads found at Chavín de Huántar, a pre-Columbian religious and political site built by the Chavín people in Peru. The Chavín religion involved human to animal transformation, or shapeshifting, achieved through the use of hallucinogenic drugs. Mabry’s heads incorporate animals commonly associated with Chavín iconography, specifically jaguars, eagles and snakes.</p>

<p>The stark contrast of these ancient figurative forms to the cool reserve of their abstract minimalist bases creates, in Mabry’s words, a “crashing together” of cultural aesthetics; this juxtaposition of ancient and contemporary is a common theme in Mabry’s oeuvre.</p>

<p>HUGO CANOILAS - MAGMA</p>

<p>With its foundations in painting, Canoilas' work is often collaborative and incorporates video, sound, sculpture and performance as well as research-based projects. Over the last decade painting has led him to establish a dialogue between abstraction and a style that nods towards social realism. With a strong interest in modernism and literature, Canoilas' practice revisits histories from a political, poetic, religious or existentialist perspective and has a capacity to be in a limbo between some of these subjects.</p>

<p>For the past 3 years Canoilas has been collecting pages from free newspapers both at home and whilst travelling. Each page is selected either because of his inability to understand or comprehend the content both in terms of language and subject. These pages then form the ground for a series of paintings made ‘blind’ in which Canoilas presses the paper face down into paint. For Workplace Gallery, Canoilas has collaged a collection of these works by overlaying specifically selected and framed works with paintings projected from transparencies on analogue overhead projectors.</p>

<p>For his recent installation Paradise Birds – at 30th São Paulo Biennial - Canoilas created a series of epic scaled paintings on unframed, unprepared canvas using a process of dipping, staining, and drawing in Ink rather than paint. Depicting characters who first explored the interior territories of Brazil the paintings move between figuration and abstraction, performance and propaganda calling into question the status of both the works as art objects and their subjects as either national hero or political tools.</p>

<p>DANIEL GORDON - THE GREEN LINE</p>

<p>In Gordon’s practice, the artist culls photographic images from the Internet, prints them out and uses them to build three-dimensional tableaus. He then photographs these tableaus with an 8 x 10 inch view camera. Afterward, the sculptures are dismantled, though their various elements - body parts, colors, background patterns - are often reused to make new works.</p>

<p>Gordon's melding together of fragmented parts form a dislocated reality where different perspectives, profiles and people merge into an incongruous whole. Through the process of slicing, cutting, gluing, staging, arranging and recycling, Gordon executes a shift from digital to analogue - almost as though he were engaged in a physical form of Photoshop—and challenges the stability of the fixed image, opening up the possibility for new meanings to emerge. This unique handling of the photographic medium connects Gordon with the history of collage and painting. In these works red, yellow and blue dominate in bold blocks.  Visibly torn edges, gobs of glue and raw, recycled scraps fuse and separate before our eyes, wavering between completion and dissolution.</p>

<p>ASHLEY BICKERTON &amp; NICOLAS POL</p>

<p>The exhibition presents a dialogue between two distinctive and wildly imaginative artists, born of different generations, who draw upon a similar reactive nature to construct vibrant, fantastical, and often times, otherworldly images of apocalyptic proportion.</p>

<p>Ashley Bickerton’s work from the late 80s and early 90s was fueled by a critical assessment of America’s obsession with consumerism; created in reaction to the sleek packaging, corporate branding, and growing reliance on technology that dominated the cultural landscape at the time. His object-based sculptures, or “Culture-scapes,” from this period were angry, defiant constructions covered in logos and seemingly built to withstand apocalyptic devastation.</p>

<p>Nicolas Pol spent much of his childhood in Africa before relocating to France, where he earned his degree from the prestigious École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, La Sorbonne. Following two successful solo shows at Alsopp Contemporary in London, Vladimir Restoin Roitfeld presented Pol’s work in three large-scale international exhibitions: The Martus Maw, New York (2009); The Mother of Pouacrus, London in (2010); and Sick Atavus of the New Blood, New York (2011).</p>

<p>TOMORY DODGE - DIRECTIONS TO A DIRTY PLACE</p>

<p>Paint can be both the image and the “stuff” of structure, moving between representation of place, and place itself. The work of Denver-born, Los Angeles-based artist Tomory Dodge and Trinidad-born, New York-based artist Denyse Thomasos slide between these poles in highly evocative ways. While much of Dodge’s imagery is drawn from things observed during excursions into the California desert, much is left to fantasy as his maps move between geography and cosmology. Thomasos creates architecture with, and through paint - spanning multiple scales to suggest the blueprints of places half-real, half-imagined.</p>

<p>SABINE MORITZ - LIMBO 2013</p>

<p>Moritz began this extraordinary body of work shortly after the attacks of 9/11, when she spent three days in Novia Scotia after her flight to New York was diverted.</p>

<p>From this foreign, isolated location she watched the immediate aftermath of the attacks and began to contemplate the changing nature of borders, conflict and the technology of war.</p>

<p>With the exception of Gelbes Kleid I and II (both inspired by a Robert Capa photograph from the 1940s) all the paintings in the exhibition are based on press clippings collected over the last ten years. Using these documentary images as a starting point Moritz deconstructs them rendering them devoid of any historical context. Moritz does not seek to directly document war but instead to approach it obliquely by focusing on rare moments of calm and intimacy of every day during conflict.</p>

<p>“Her stated desire is to free the motifs from their immediate history and from the words that accompany them. Moritz’s war paintings are not about specific incidents, specific people, and specific wars; instead they reflect broader historical phenomena, such as our era’s new wars, and by extension, the Cold War.”</p>

<p>Moritz creates an atmosphere in which tension is omnipresent without the use of explicit violence and images of carnage.</p>

<p>CANAN TOLON - SOMEWHERE NOW</p>

<p>Canan Tolon’s paintings at first appear as purely abstract, but with time the eye discovers familiar urban landscapes in the rhythmic painted streaks. She explores the visualization of space by creating an illusion of depth and engages the viewer in the game of seeking recognizable imagery and inventing a visual narrative. The black and white pieces in particular allude to the documentary quality of photography, suggesting reality where there is only imagination. Like a distant mirage, the viewer is drawn into the work, wanting to explore the multiple layers of information. With even closer inspection, the elusive vistas dissolve back into abstract patterns revealing the painting’s deception. This duality makes the imagery unstable, flickering between truth and illusion to create an ever-interesting visual feast.</p>

<p>PRUDENCIO IRAZABAL</p>

<p>In his new works, Prudencio Irazabal untiringly pursues his investigation which, through an etymological enquiry coupled with an analysis of the purely physical properties of painting, seeks to understand the painting process as something that is played out not only on the surface but also at the deeper layers of a painting. Such an emphatically material way of seeing has yielded over the years contrasting meanings, so that one could describe this way of seeing as being “perpendicular to the surface” of the canvas.</p>

<p>By using so-called “persistence techniques” - essentially similarly repetitive applications of transluscent colours on one and the same area of the canvas -the artist provokes a revelation of traces that only a long period of time spent on a work can create. Some of the works exhibited took up to five years to produce.</p>

<p>Without minimisng the importance of those aspects of painting which a camera can pick up on and reproduce on screen or on paper, these work procedures create perception zones that the viewer can make out only by standing directly in front of the painting.</p>

<p>Although the inner life of paintings has not received much attention outside museum restauration departments, for Irizabal it weighs heavily in the act of perception. To reveal it or be able to see it without the aid of tools, the artist uses a highly transparent acrylic material. For transparency not only creates depth and forces material to defer to light, but by not requiring study or analysis it functions autonomously before the naked and trusting eye.</p>

<p>NATHAN JAMES - CREEPSHOW</p>

<p>Creepshow showcases unseen work, and marks a dark evolution in the painter’s style.
The new series takes its inspiration from the concept of Pessimist Pop – a direct reaction to the highly-polished, busy, celebratory work of Koons, Murakami et al – and sees James deal in similar bold shapes and cultural iconography, but switch focus to the underbelly of his subjects, contextualising them in a real, unforgiving world. Painting in oil (often making his own paints) on canvas or linen, James focuses on the lives and worlds of the underclass, failures, perverts and slackers, rather than beautiful, successful people.
‘Like all the best art, Nathan James’ new paintings challenge the idea that beauty is a universal term.’ Jake Chapman</p>

<p>Bleak comedy and personal tragedy sit uncomfortably close together in James’ characters, which draw on both the failed industrial background of his childhood in Ontario, and the fantastical world of cartoons, characters and the golden age of Hollywood, which has long fascinated him.
Combining an almost old-fashioned, painterly approach to his art with very modern ideas of representation and humour, his subjects are captured in various states of disintegration, mutation and grotesque evolution. Creepshow is at once, a deeply personal and voyeuristic document of lives, habits, problems and people who contemporary art often overlooks.</p>

<p>DIVERSE ELEMENTS</p>

<p>A group exhibition of works by Kai &amp; Sunny and Leif Podhajsky, whose artistic practice straddles the increasingly unstable boundaries between fashion, advertising, graphic design and fine art.
Kai &amp; Sunny are a multidisciplinary duo who's work appears in many arenas of art. Their intricate, natural and sometimes sinister style has led them to collaborate with Alexander McQueen and has won them numerous accolades including a 2012 DA&amp;D Design Award, and book covers with author David Mitchell. The artists have exhibited internationally, showing at Haunch Of Venison London, and have recently been included in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum print archive collection. The duo are currently exploring natural forms with large-scale monotone works through print making.</p>

<p>“The highly acclaimed, award-winning art duo Kai &amp; Sunny have risen to notoriety over the past few years thanks to their beautiful and highly-detailed nature-inspired images”-Hypebeast.com</p>

<p>Leif Podhajsky is an artist and Creative Director. His work explores themes of connectedness, the relevance of nature and the psychedelic or altered experience. By utilising these subjects he attempts to inspire the viewer into a realignment with themselves and their surroundings. The Australian artist and creative director has masterminded the visuals for Foals’ hotly-anticipated third album, ‘Holy Fire’, and quickly become the go-to guy for the likes of Sub Pop, Modular, Warp Records and more.</p>

<p>JOSE PARLA - PROSE</p>

<p>His uniquely expressive painting style, which incorporates elements of both language and writing, has been winning international acclaim. For Parlá, walls are sites where the energy, history, and culture of urban society are located, and where human memory and psychology are inscribed.</p>

<p>His work takes its starting point from walking around the international cities where he travels, observing and documenting them in order to start a dialogue with the place. 
His paintings are distinguished by their all-over layered backgrounds, made up of paints and collages of found objects like posters, and rhythmically drawn calligraphic writings overlaid onto the different layers. The backgrounds in his works consist of segments of city wall interpreted and rebuilt from his own impressions of them, and the writings resemble journal or diary entries lodged within his memories, or the inspirations he obtains from these walls. Although the abstracted texts constitute an indecipherable language entirely his own, when combined with the layers of painting, they evoke a panoply of stories that unfold within our imagination.</p>

<p>José Parlá summarizes the work in the exhibition PROSE:
"stream of consciousness ⎯ a rhythmic structure that carries the energy and poetic painting body in flux with dance ⎯ defined by memory brought into action in its own moment ⎯ imbedded in an improvisational blend of performance ⎯ founded on research and observation that forms the visual compositions before us ⎯ evoking a metropolitan narrative ⎯ presenting an objective truth"</p>

<p>SABRINA FRITSCH - PORTAL OPAK</p>

<p>The geometrical window vistas in Sabrina Fritsch's new works enable a view onto an indefinite space, which subtly attracts us and simultaneously prompts questions about what exactly is depicted on the image area. Are we situated inside or outside the room - or are we located in some sort of "interspace"? Through her open and, nevertheless, precise approach towards spatial structures, the artist conducts us into an active process of seeing and experiencing.</p>

<p>Layered coatings of paint, which are elaborately applied and then again abraded and flattened, define the the delicately nuanced image structure of her window vistas. Thereupon, Fritsch arranges geometrical signs, that are reminiscent of (window) frames consisting of shutter like, finely reticulated crossbars; through which we can vaguely see what's taking place on the other side. In some paintings she adds large, succulent shapes, which resemble the leaves of an indoor plant.</p>

<p>The window paintings unify Fritsch's interest in colour fields, materiality and structure. She moves along the edge of abstraction and figuration, between level expanse and potential depth perception and  interlinks the alleged divergent positions. The very essence of her works is the involvement  of painting in combination with the beholder's active view, which the artist very pointedly and sensitively implements.</p>

<p>NOAH DAVIS - THE MISSING LINK</p>

<p>In this new body of work, Davis broadens, and in some cases breaks open completely the narrative of black youth culture in the inner cities, creating what he terms an “alternative canon” of unfamiliar instances, broken moments, derelict conversations and strange urban stories that have at their core an essential human longing, a nearly verifiable pulse, a “beat” as it were of a broader cosmopolitan cool.</p>

<p>Davis’ paintings brim over with musical nuances and references, while others explore more concisely the complicated relationships between figures attempting to speak or share information. The colors become their own identifiable narrative trope, suggesting a civic bureaucracy, a mold that the figures attempt to break free from at every turn.</p>

<p>PAUL ANTHONY SMITH - TRANSIENCE</p>

<p>Acutely aware of his status as an immigrant artist, Smith was inspired by trips back to Jamaica, as well as research into its history and that of the broader African diaspora. Interested in ideas of hierarchy, culture, and identity, both as fact and nostalgic reimagining, his sources range from his own contemporary photographs to historical images and books, such as Tropical Africa and The River Plate Republics: Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, c. 1960s Time-Life publications.</p>

<p>A bold sequence of large oil paintings and smaller painted works on paper depict Jamaican airport workers as they work, converse, and mill about the tarmac. On his most recent trip, the artist was struck by these almost invisible first ambassadors of sorts, one of many crucial aspects to his native country’s biggest industry. Rendered simply and boldly in poses summoning classic references as well as Jamaica’s famously relaxed style, the figures are elevated to epic proportions. Their bright safety vests and simple uniforms hint at a common dignity while contrasting boldly with the very dark skin hues that the artist prefers: “Their tonality casts a distinction around the surrounding environment of a piece.”</p>

<p>These painted works contrast with unique, jewel-like “picotages.” Smith uses a ceramic tool to laboriously pick away at the surface material of photographic prints, a unique technique loosely derived from an 18th century French process typically used with textiles. Though the process is purely ablative, the resultant texture creates a shimmering surface, as if flecked with glitter.</p>

<p>PETER HUTCHINSON - THE LOGIC OF MOUNTAINS</p>

<p>Hutchinson is a true renaissance man, in every sense of the word. Part fanatical botanist, part consummate humorist, part die-hard TV sitcom enthusiast (he can practically recite every episode from Cheers and Seinfeld from heart), Peter again defies easy labeling. Visiting his garden and studio, especially in the summer, which he shares with several half-feral cats and includes a rare species of orchid he himself discovered and named, is a rare treat.</p>

<p>The stories I’ve shared with Peter over the years are many. There’s the summer in the 90’s he introduced me to his then-dealer from NY, the legendary Holly Solomon, who wore her mink coat the entire visit (it was August), even as we lunched on lobster roll melts on the deck of DNA, my Provincetown gallery, and planned his next exhibition. There was the time I was swept off my feet – quite literally – at a busy intersection in Soho on the way to Henry Geldzahler’s memorial, after we drank a pair of bee-pollen/spirulina/high-protein shakes and Peter suddenly decided he knew the best way to cure his art dealer’s backache. There was the first time I tasted his homemade dandelion wine before a studio visit, and a few glasses later – like wearing 3-D glasses – was seeing incredible new dimensions in the already surreal photo-collages. There were long meandering walks in the beech forest near his house, testing various species of wild mushrooms (with serious trepidation) and being very grateful to survive another day. But above all, there is Peter Hutchinson’s work itself – bursting with color, humor and a kind of quiet, understated subversiveness.</p>

<p>STÉPHANE DAFFLON - SWING</p>

<p>This artist summons his viewer as much to a rediscovery of the venue as to a perceiving of autonomous forms. Just as Airless, his first exhibition at Air de Paris (2000) brought his personal physical touch to bear on the actual exhibition space, this new show will see him applying his range of slender lines to both canvases and walls. Liberated from the streamlined design shapes they may have been borrowed from, these lines sometimes follow the edges of his stretchers, divide up the walls and redraw their corners. Space is no longer just to be traversed, but also to be displaced, vectored, transferred.</p>

<p>This exhibition will be a chance to observe the way Dafflon's practice is rooted in shifts, while, incidentally, embracing all the operations already mentioned – none of which, alone, would exhaust its complexity: shifts of format (stretcher size governed by the size of the passages), of colour (the tones of the canvases and the wall paintings reflecting two contradictory movements) and of placement (according to the transfers effected).</p>

<p>MICHAEL BAUER - SLOW FUTURE-H.S.O.P.-OPUS</p>

<p>Bauer loves titles - the more deliberately obscure and diverse the better - and this series is no exception. The 'slow' of Slow Future refers to his pace in working, building layer upon layer, organically but never systematically, and because one of the things Bauer has always valued about painting is that it's slower than other media.<br>H.S.O.P. is an acronym for the Hudson River School of painting - a 19th century fraternity of American landscape painters who hold no significance for Bauer other than the fact that they've become unfashionable and he likes the idea of "colonizing their memory". He fundamentally disagrees with the notion that painting itself has become obsolete and, by annexing a school devoted to it, seeks to re-emphasize that painting remains not only central to his future, but to the future. Opus is a typically self-deprecating Bauer addendum, a tongue-in-cheek nod to the fact that he doesn't see this or any other of his series as fitting into an ordered theory or composition.</p>

<p>Bauer usually adds some kind of coding system to his paintings' surfaces, alluding to a faux structure at each of their premises. These have recently taken the form of colour-coded punctuation, but in most of the paintings here the only graphic notation he uses are deliberate red herrings: Bauer has painted small flags in their corners, chosen not because of any personal geographic or historical relevance, but because they are from lesser-known nations that he didn't recognise and are often confused with more prominent countries. What's particularly appealing to Bauer is that any flag, known or unknown, carries so much invented history. So, in addition to these being framing devices or heraldic elements for each painting, he wants them to function as "traps of meaning" in the context of all the other clues in the works.</p>

<p>MIRANDA DONOVAN - WALLS</p>

<p>Donovan’s work fuses an exploration into sculpture and colour with a dedication to the possibilities and practice of painting, to create utterly unique ‘urban’ art. Her works are manifestations of the melancholic march of time.</p>

<p>For this exhibition, Donovan will present over twenty paintings all of which return to her ongoing fascination with walls. This time they are often life-size in scale. The larger works are characterized by their three dimensional quality, seen here to an even greater extent than in her previous work, built up in layers of resin, foam, plaster and paint. The textural and tactile aspects are very apparent in the larger works, which are essentially ‘sculptural paintings’. They hang on the wall but are often 10cm deep in thickness. Due to the sheer physicality and weightiness of these larger pieces, on initial glance these works may seem to the viewer to be walls literally hacked out from their surroundings and displayed in a gallery – but in fact they are sculptures, where even the bricks are fabricated, reproduced in a super-real style through the prism of Donovan’s artistry. Liberated and uncompromising, they reveal a level of sophistication and confidence perhaps not immediately apparent in Donovan’s previous work.</p>

<p>GARY HUME - LIBERTY GRIP</p>

<p>For each of the three discrete sections of Liberty Grip, Hume used as a template the arm of a mannequin, enlarging this mass-produced, utilitarian object to a colossal scale.<br>Hume then positioned the three arms into an evocative group of forms that suggests both a bundle of limbs or a contorted hand. Bronze on this scale usually commemorates the feat of a war hero or the triumphs of a nation, but with Liberty Grip Hume toys with our conventional uses of monumental sculpture, treating it with mischievous sense of scale, even painting the tips of the abruptly cut-off limbs a playful, intimate colour. Liberty Grip brings to mind the detached and colossal hand of the Roman Emperor Constantine, yet where that sculpture, now in fragments, celebrated the feats of a leader, Hume swaps bravado for all the sensuality and wit that characterise his paintings.</p>

<p>ADAM ADACH</p>

<p>“Das Jahrhundert der Judenbuche” (The Century of the Jewish Beech) is the heading of Adam Adachs thoughts that he has neatly divided into a text of four sections. The Berlin exhibition, to which these thoughts belong, is prepared in a period when the German newspapers are full of the term "century". Yet the turn of the last century, also the turn of a millennium, is more than ten years back in time. Recently, however, the book “1913: Der Sommer des Jahrhunderts” (1913: The Summer of the Century) was released. In this book art historian Florian Illies describes that summer one hundred years ago, the year before the First World War began.</p>

<p>Adach is known for basing his paintings on photos, as are many other artists, among them Gerhard Richter. "Nazi holidays" shows a beach scene. Sparsely-clothed people are lying or sitting on the beach or are standing at the railing watching the sea. Unrecognizable flags are hanging from the flagpoles; the sail of the boat on the horizon is as white as a flag of truce. Only the title brings cruelty to the painting. In the century of two world wars, the murderers and their families, and also those who had brought them to power, were sunning themselves on the beach. Kraft durch Freude – Strength through Joy.</p>

<p>SIMEÓN SAIZ RUIZ</p>

<p>Let's look. Whereas Alberti said that a painting should represent people of all ages and conditions, in my exhibition there will be paintings that span the entire range of possibilities in terms of the nature of the pictures. There are those based on real documents (television images) and those based on fictitious documents (other paintings). There will be pictures taken directly from reality-in their own way, all these pictures are records of something real translated into painting codes-and images that only exist in and of themselves. Fictitious images will be missing.?The absence should stand out noticeably, because I want to address the real, not simulations. I am aware of the important blend of fiction and non-fiction in the art production of recent years, which forces us to take a stand in this regard. My stance is that interpretation of reality is already a fiction. It may address a real world or a fantasy world. Imagination entertains us, but what we need to change is the real world. We can fictionalize it partially so as to make it more habitable and thus use it so as not to see what it is made of, and especially so as not to know how it may change.</p>

<p>There are two series in this space, one that ends and another that begins. The times with their own waves of transformations are what compel the changes. I am not going to dwell on the effects of the economic crisis or the loss of credibility, not to mention the legitimacy, of politics, and the sensation of the dictatorship of capital. The two series blend together in the exhibition and I hope something unique is born of their dialogue.</p>

<p>THOM GORST - RUINS OF EMPIRE</p>

<p>Drawing inspiration from the early work of the Boyle Family and sharing their concerns for the pictorial quality of the everyday – and from the current interest in ruination and urban exploration, this work re-presents and re-aestheticises marks made by rust, salt, wear, abrasion and contingent alteration. His work draws our attention back to the sea, and is a fitting exhibition to be held in a warehouse gallery that is itself so redolent with memories of trade and the business of Empire.</p>

<p>It was suggested early in the study that he should make the marks `of an architect’ in response to the experience of visiting these sites of dereliction. It was not clear how an architect typically might make marks, unless these were to be measured or orthogonal; certainly privileging the visual, and delineating the boundaries of space, rather than the gradations of texture, of accretions and of contingent archaeology. It was an unplanned part of the academic unfolding of the subject that in late 2008 the first paintings were made.</p>

<p>KIERAN MOORE - GODS &amp; SPACEMEN IN THE ANCIENT WEST</p>

<p>The show’s title refers to a book by W. Raymond Drake, a Ufologist and writer who entertained the notion of the human race being supported in antique times by benevolent aliens [Drake worked in a similar theme to the perhaps better known Erich Von Däniken]. While this is not the overriding theme in Moore’s work, the otherworldliness, the Wheatley-esque suburban occultism and the whiff of the profane conjured by the title are intrinsic aspects of his drawings.</p>

<p>Moore's work is inspired by diverse sources, ranging from folk-horror movies to the spandex-clad gender confusion of glam rock, and the European elegance and decadence of the soft-focus erotic photography of yesteryear’s Sunday supplement book clubs. It embraces the fantastical world of Medieval Christian mythology; the obsessive attention to detail and interest in the costume of the Flemish ‘Primitives’ and painters such as Ingres; the ambiguous ephebes who populate many paintings produced in post-revolutionary France; and the strains of more recent and contemporary hauntology music.</p>

<p>MICHAEL KREBBER</p>

<p>Would you confirm that ‘painting’ is used / explored by you as a filter?</p>

<p>Might that question ask about a possible programme of ‘painting’? Its application? In that case: painting, as well as any other activity, runs as an application that regularly and constantly changes, from for one person communicating with himself, to two people or more. Like society, here the programme runs wild, everyone might be in a different programme, either actively or passively…</p>

<p>Is ‘painting’ still seen as a controversial activity?</p>

<p> Jack Smith said that buying and possessing art was wrong, it was against the idea of art. Here lies the contradiction. But painting is also qualified as an image of the enemy, it therefore can easily seem to be used as a controversial activity. This became kind of common knowledge for the ‘knowing ones’ and I think I benefit a bit from that. And it is still an open game. Please read my text “Puberty in Painting”.</p>

<p>Do you have to ‘defend’ artistically the use of painting as a medium?</p>

<p> I think “Puberty in Painting” says it all and I do not want to defend or preserve it.  Instead of ‘defending’, I would prefer to throw in the idea of: identification with the aggressor.</p>

<p>What type of information does your painting contain?</p>

<p>Depends on who will look at it. Mixed in with all kinds of personal issues of mine. This could also become a game, if somebody wanted to play.</p>

<p>Anecdotes, references, social networks have become an integrated visible part in your work. Does it belong to the ‘painting’?</p>

<p> I heard somebody using the term ‘expanded painting’. In his text “Painting beside itself”, David Joselit quotes Martin Kippenberger who said in an interview about a painting, that not only the painting was important, but everything around it too, the people that the painter talked to, his whole network and also the noodles that he ate.</p>

<p>NICK VAN WOERT - NO MAN'S LAND</p>

<p>"No man's land" is a term used to refer to unoccupied land, a dumping ground, or an area abandoned due to uncertain fate. This idea of an uninhabitable region relays van Woert's continued obsession with ecology, geology, and the complex history of terrain – one that is both inherent and fabricated. Through painting, photography, sculpture, and installation, No Man's Land explores the relationship between artificial substance and the environment, while considering the possible results of those liaisons affecting anatomy or mental disposition.</p>

<p>A series of ten paintings, each a monochromatic panel, references colors found in landscape paintings of the American West from the 1800s. Minimalist in appearance, these works are in fact concocted from myriad man-made products ranging from cat litter to orange soda. The dichotomy, present due to the toxic chemistry of substances used to describe natural properties of pristine landscapes, translates van Woert's fixation with the destructive potential of modern convenience.</p>

<p>Van Woert transitions to conveying the broader directive of a primitivist lifestyle with a large-scale installation. Its physical appearance literally implies a simple log cabin wall, yet the visual manifestation of its presence posits a foreboding symbol. The individual elements, constructed of cast coal slag, have a black, sooty facade, giving the impression of partial remains left after a fire. The visual extreme in this work – a modest structure with a tragic past – points to the vulnerability and possibly idealistic notion of practicing true "simple living."</p>

<p>BARBARA HEPWORTH - THE HOSPITAL DRAWINGS</p>

<p>In the late 1940s Barbara Hepworth embarked on a series of studies of the operating theatre at the invitation of her friend, the surgeon Norman Capener. Over a two-year period, (1947-49), Hepworth produced around 80 works within the series. As well as pencil, ink and chalk drawings, many were executed in both pencil and oil paint on board, and as such can be seen as both paintings and drawings. The remarkable artworks demonstrate Hepworth's consummate skill as a draftsperson and the synergy she felt between her work as a sculptor and the surgeon's craft.</p>

<p>ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG - JAMMERS</p>

<p>In the early 1970s, Rauschenberg moved his permanent studio from New York City to Captiva Island, off the Gulf coast of Florida (Today, this site is in use as the artists’ residency program of the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation). This relocation marked a shift from the gritty urban detritus that had been the basis of much of the earlier work to a rhapsodic embrace of color and geometric abstraction in a wholly new vernacular language.</p>

<p>The Jammers series (1975–76), its title a direct reference to the Windjammer sailing vessel, is Rauschenberg’s salute to his new island life. In 1975, he also went to India to investigate textiles and papermaking, and the inspiration of this new and exotic context is evident in the use of vivid colors and nuanced textures of cotton, muslin, and silk.</p>

<p>For the most part, the Jammers comprise stitched fabrics in pure, solid colors, affixed to rattan poles or hung directly and loosely on the wall; whereas in works such as Sprout (1975) and Caliper (1976), the unadorned poles are the principal formal element, propped against the wall. Departing from Rauschenberg’s densely collaged imagery or muscular, layered materials, the Jammers are simple and light, focusing on the transparency and seductiveness of veil-like fabrics, that are lent sculptural structure by the cloth-covered poles or other found objects.  In Quarterhorse (1975), segments of blue, green, tan and yellow cloth evoke sandy beaches, palm trees, and bright sunshine.  In Index (1976), widths of gleaming azure and white satin drape together, a diptych of clouds and sea. The hot, saturated hues of Pimiento III (1976) and Mirage (1976) attest to more exotic influences; while Coin (1976) incorporates found tin cans, stripped of their labels, gleaming mysteriously inside a gauze bag that sags under their weight.</p>

<p>CONOR HARRINGTON</p>

<p>A Whole Lot of Trouble for a Little Bit of Win features Conor’s coveted ‘Morning Glory’ miniatures. The Irish artist paints the studies daily upon arriving at his studio to catalyse the creative process. Their content veers from details within, and examinations of, forthcoming paintings to abstract, ethereal portraits featuring the pantheon of characters featuring in his latest geo-political ballad.</p>

<p>Created using oils and spray paint on canvas board, each Morning Glory is attributed a date and presented in a box frame without glass. They measure approximately 40cm high by 30cm wide without the frame. Where Conor’s smash-hit 2012 exhibition Dead Meat concerned the decadent collapse of the European haut-bourgeoisie, his latest paintings refer specifically to the rise of new superpowers.</p>

<p>MARCIN MACIEJOWSKI</p>

<p>The work of Marcin Maciejowski re-presents everyday images of our time. Using those already in popular circulation as starting points - found photographs, movies, posters, newspaper illustrations - his paintings naturally inherit the social and political implications of their source material.</p>

<p>Current affairs, film stills, military and religious figures and film noir femmes fatales all populate his art. Witty and often ironic, these subjects are presented in a deliberate abandonment of the traditions associated with the history of painting. Echoing the speed of the digital reproduction, the slowness of his chosen, analogue, medium brings an examination of the role of painting in today's cultural world.</p>

<p>JOSÉ PARLÁ - BROKEN LANGUAGE</p>

<p>José Parlá’s vibrant works explore the multi-layered histories of cities and urban environments; his paintings and site-specific installations are created both in his large carriage house studio and also works outside throughout city surfaces. His expressive painting style and layers of ephemera and found objects combined with calligraphic abstraction have a lyrical feel to them, are uniquely his. This exhibition presents new paintings, works on paper, photographs and sculptures throughout our three gallery spaces.</p>

<p>Parla’s work acts as a record of his journeys through streets that he navigates, using a map of one city to direct you through another. He documents his city walks through photographs as well as at times collecting detritus from the streets, once back in the studio they are used to build the composition of each painting.</p>

<p>Language and writing are key themes within Parlá’s work. He often incorporates layers of text from street posters he collects while traveling. His own stylized calligraphy is worked into and on the surface of each painting, and although it is always partially obscured and indecipherable, it is a personal narrative of his experiences and a record of stories he discovers on his various journeys.</p>

<p>KEITH TYSON - PANTA RHEI</p>

<p>The exhibition features sixteen paintings inspired by poetry, music, and personal references, executed by the artist over the last three years.<br>
Panta Rhei, which translates as “everything flows” in Ancient Greek, embodies the idea of a world in perpetual motion, a fundamental concept for Tyson.</p>

<p>Drawing parallels between previous bodies of work, Tyson explains: “In the past, I’ve always tried to represent what I call the ’Field’, which for me, is the myriad of networks – whether physical, conceptual or emotional – that make the present moment. All these systems combined form our interdependent world. I attempted to reflect these associations through sculptures, in the immersive installation Large Field Array or on a smaller scale, through the fluid dynamics of the Nature Paintings. This time, I wanted to gather the ideas and techniques I’d learnt in previous pieces and work exclusively with paint to compose visual poems.”</p>

<p>RICHARD PRINCE</p>

<p>Fourteen expansive canvases hybridise the forms of various recent series. Each canvas features an over-painted ink-jet print of a single female figure or giantess, a hybrid of Prince’s Rasta paintings, De Kooning paintings, and a separate series of works inspired by Picasso. The women teeter between the appearance of neoclassical marbles and fragments of soft porn. Through Prince’s interventions in acrylic, the torsos metamorphose into gigantic sculptural bodies, with wrestling mask heads and elongated, angular limbs painted in grisaille tones.</p>

<p>In line with much of Prince’s art, these paintings grapple with the idea of influence, reusing and deconstructing his own and other artists’ iconography in order to challenge the avant-garde gospel of ‘originality’. In the late 2000s, Prince began a cycle of paintings which similarly corrupted Willem de Kooning’s ‘Women’ series - conflating the originals with pornographic ink-jet prints and sections of expressive, ‘painterly’ brushwork. In this latest series, the figures’ masked faces, box-like appendages and clubbed extremities often jar absurdly with their agile poses. In defiance of painting’s fervent movement away from photographic styles of representation throughout the twentieth century, Prince cheekily injects photography back into the picture. These works profess their sources – their debt to Cubism and Abstract Expressionism, at the same time as they express a close sympathy with (and perhaps a nostalgia for) the grand painterly statements of Modernism.</p>

<p>KURT SCHWITTERS - SCHWITTERS IN BRITIAN</p>

<p>Schwitters in Britain is the first major exhibition to examine the late work of Kurt Schwitters, one of the major artists of European Modernism. The exhibition focuses on his British period, from his arrival in Britain as a refugee in 1940 until his death in Cumbria in 1948. Schwitters was forced to flee Germany when his work was condemned as ‘degenerate’ by Germany’s Nazi government and the show traces the impact of exile on his work. It includes over 150 collages, assemblages and sculptures many shown in the UK for the first time in over 30 years.</p>

<p>Schwitters was a significant figure in European Dadaism who invented the concept of Merz – ‘the combination, for artistic purposes of all conceivable materials’. Whether those materials were string, cotton wool or a pram wheel, Schwitters considered them to be equal with paint. He is best known for his pioneering use of found objects and everyday materials in abstract collage, installation, poetry and performance. Schwitters’s time in Britain was quite extraordinary and continues to reverberate today, with the influence he has exerted over artists such as Richard Hamilton, Eduardo Paolozzi and Damien Hirst.</p>

<p>CIPRIAN MURESAN</p>

<p>The central work of the exhibition, Shredded Masaccio Book, presents the shredded paper remains of a hand-drawn version  of Ornella Casazza’s text on the Italian Renaissance painter Masaccio. Titled Masaccio: and the Brancacci Chapel and published by Scala/Riverside
(1990), the Italian artist Masaccio died at the young age of 26, while Muresan’s pencil-drawn book likewise had a short life, remaining in tact only for the days that it took for the artist to complete its pages. Before deconstructing the book, Muresan documented its pages and converted them into the form of a video slideshow. Nonetheless, Muresan invites the individual who purchases the work to devote an 
extensive amount of his or her time to taping the paper fragments back together.</p>

<p>For the video piece Untitled, Muresan worked with two stage directors to simultaneously orchestrate two different performances on the same stage. The directors were given complete freedom in choosing the play they would stage, while both they and the participating actors 
remained unaware of what the other group would perform, until both parties got on stage. Through this forced overlap, Muresan generates a new text, but also creates moments of chaos and harmony, thereby extending the communicative boundaries of the two individual theatre pieces.</p>

<p>BRICE MARDEN - RED YELLOW BLUE</p>

<p>This is the first time that all four paintings comprising the historic group have been shown together, with loans from MOCA, Los Angeles, The Albright Knox Museum, Buffalo, and private collections in the U.S.  Fourth Figure (Red Yellow Blue) (1973–74), a related painting that treats the chromatic primaries as a composition of three horizontal bands, will also be on view.</p>

<p>Marden’s early monochromatic paintings exist as single panels, diptychs and triptychs. Restraining the gestural intensity of Color Field painting through contemplative reserve and calm, their inscrutable surfaces belie a nuanced equilibrium between emotive passion and formal rigor.</p>

<p>In each of the Red Yellow Blue paintings (1974), Marden painted slabs of dense yet nuanced color  on three adjoined canvas panels, using oil paint mixed on the spot with melted beeswax and turpentine and applied with a knife and spatula. The dull sheen of the encaustic medium intensifies the bold, contrasting color blocks, built up through the temperamental layering process that yielded such intricately worked surfaces. The spirited variations within each "primary" trio (where red can range from cadmium to almost black, yellow from ochre to saffron, and blue from cobalt to sullen indigo) are rich with interpretative possibility, like musical chords improvised in major and minor keys.</p>

<p>MATT BRYANS</p>

<p>Bryans has recently transferred his process of erasure from newspaper cuttings to brick. As with his newspaper works he has taken a pre-existing, familiar material and eroded the surface, revealing new forms. Bryans has not only used a local material but also one that is heavily associated with Englishness. Bricks are the foundation of England's built environment and were the cornerstone of the industrial revolution. The old lives of these bricks, found in bombsites and other places in and around London, are carved into an odd, organic demeanour. Freed from their mortar they are sculpted into something that appears to have been eroded by nature.</p>

<p>The newspaper collages are Bryans' take on the ancient English theme of landscape. The artist has described them as "annihilated landscapes". They are a profusion of archetypal and empty spaces suffused with a melancholy presence. In Bryans' work a poetic transformation takes place, an alchemy with contemporary and banal found materials, producing something suggestive of worlds that exist in some legendary or fictional past tense. Examining his works there is a sense that we are penetrating the surface of things, getting under the skin of the world. His hallucinatory newspaper landscapes also seem to reflect political issues buried in our contemporary landscape.</p>

<p>ROSEMARIE TROCKEL - A COSMOS</p>

<p>In A Cosmos she places her work in the company of others to explore varying disciplines. Central to the exhibition are a number of core works, including new works never seen before in the UK, by Trockel, and arranged around these in a constellation according to type and theme are artefacts, both natural and human.</p>

<p>A Cosmos reflects the artist's interest in creating a space for ideas to exist between different disciplines, past and present. Many of the objects and artworks, selected by Trockel in dialogue with curator Lynne Cooke, produce a context for the artist's work within other fields of inquiry, such as the natural sciences and natural history. Watercolours painted by the pioneering botanist Maria Sibylla Merian sit alongside intricate models of marine invertebrates crafted by Leopold and Rudolph Blaschka, initially used as research tools by naturalists who had no access to living specimens.</p>

<p>DAN WITZ - PRISONERS 2012-13</p>

<p>Dan Witz has been at the forefront of artists working on the street since the late 1970s. Combining digital reproduction with the old master's technique of illusionism, the artist's lifelike figures appear as if from nowhere on signposts, walls, windows and manhole covers across the world. Painted and layered over digital photographs, each image is designed to surprise the viewer, taking them aback and from the expected into an alarming state of disbelief.</p>

<p>In those works from his Mosh Pit series, figures intertwine and climb over one another with the pressure, pain and joy expressed at different stages of the mosh. For the adjacent Prisoners, Witz partnered with Amnesty International, the world's largest human rights organization to gain access to individuals who are subjects of their campaign for rights awareness. As a symbolic reference to their real-life struggles, each of these imprisoned individuals is portrayed with few clothes, masked or with their hands tied.</p>

<p>To coincide with the exhibition, the artist will dispersing his unique stamp on the British streets by painting one of his prisoner's image onto London phone boxes.</p>

<p>MARIO YBARRA JR. - DOUBLE FEATURE</p>

<p>Over the past decade, Ybarra has developed a practice centered around storytelling. With an eye and ear for the elements of an engaging narrative, accompanied by healthy doses of wit, Ybarra crafts portraits of people, places and communities that are resonant and universal while rooted in the specific. Using the objects and materials that he finds around him and his subjects, he translates personal stories into resonant and multilayered installations that seamlessly blend the languages of art and life. Often, the installations relate the overlooked or unacknowledged; particularly, the lives and dreams of his family, childhood friends, and colorful personalities that make up his community. He makes connections to these local tales for global audiences far from Wilmington, often by relating these individual stories refracted through lenses such as mass media and popular culture.</p>

<p>Double Feature consists of two projects that cull portraits from iconic Hollywood films, mining this deep repository for our collective fantasies. In Universal Monsters, Ybarra finds inspiration in a series of classic horror/sci-fi films produced by Universal Studios in the 1920s-1960s for a series of self-portraits. Simultaneously playful and disarmingly revealing, these works are a psychologically rich exploration of the persona of the artist. Imagining versions of himself filtered through the lens of the creatures of the Universal stable, Ybarra's multimedia renderings of id build upon our own relationships with these celluloid nightmares.</p>

<p>GERARD BYRNE - A STATE OF NEUTRAL PLEASURE</p>

<p>Renowned for his films installations which re-enact conversations from specific historic moments, Irish artist Gerard Byrne’s work explores the way we understand the present through revisiting the past. Always diverse, his subjects have included the Loch Ness monster, the possible location of Samuel Beckett’s play Waiting for Godot and the history of Minimalist art. For this exhibition, Byrne’s investigations range from the politics around sexuality to the production and display of the art object.</p>

<p>Premiering in the UK is A man and a woman make love (2012). This multi-screen installation reinterprets discussions about sexuality and eroticism held in the 1920s by the Surrealist group of artists and writers, including André Breton, Jacques Prévert and Yves Tanguy. A thing is a hole in a thing it is not (2010) borrows its title from a statement by sculptor Carl Andre and re-examines seminal moments from 1960s debates around Minimalism.</p>

<p>JOSEPH STASHKEVETCH - THE MORE THINGS CHANGE</p>

<p>This latest body of work represents some of Stashkevetch's most complex drawings to date. The subject matter, thousands of river-washed pebbles and rocky debris, lacy treetops emerging from the mist and striated mountains covered in snow, is executed with a painstaking level of intricacy and detail.</p>

<p>Stashkevetch develops his large-scale black and white compositions gradually, employing his signature technique. In progressive stages, the paper's surface is sanded away as the image is built up with conte crayon. The conte bonds to the paper, and the two materials become one. The process, both additive and reductive, creates an atmospheric quality in which light and shadow are in constant play.</p>

<p>Time is palpable in these monumental works. This is owed in part to the imagery, which alludes to the enduring history and cyclical nature of our planet. Yet the subject matter itself, the 'what' and the 'where,' becomes secondary. Standing before the work, one's focus shifts instead to the patterns embedded in the surface of the paper and the sheer breadth of Stashkevetch's compositions. Each mark is emblematic of the artist's time as the drawings break down and become as abstract as time itself. The imagery, while striking in its beauty, is merely a framework upon which Stashkevetch masterfully builds his effects.</p>

<p>VICTOR BEREZOVSKY</p>

<p>"Ostensibly seductive, the work of Berezovsky can be understood as still life, architectural landscape, but above all as portrait, and as an exterior view of man.
However, the pictorial objects soon prove to be arranged not by virtue of their concrete basis. They operate with the sensuous presence of their painterly composition on the level of symbolic significance.
The outcome of their pictorial metaphors, full of surreal appeal, uses the simplest, archaic, and demotic elements together with a complex metalanguage in a virtuoso combination of ingenious constructions and laboratory processes.
The selective dislocations of color and format serve as augurs of meaning in the narrative of interior visualisation.</p>

<p>The surreal, psychologising pictures of the real self in the works of Berezovsky draw the observer closer to their specificity. These painterly appraisals of existence carried out here are in truth images of thinking about thinking, images of the conditions and limits of thinking about thinking processes, and their resulting (fatal) real effects.
These works are narratives and reports at the same time, not of the reality or irreality of things, but, in fact, of the (self-)generation of realities.</p>

<p>MICHAEL GENOVESE</p>

<p>These raised, sculptural “drawings” suggest following the maxim that common sense is the shortest distance between two points or to recognize the grace in directness. Genovese recreates various, common occurrences of line – an architectural fracture; a hair in the bathtub; the mark of automatic writing; a military line of demarcation; a varicose vein, or a simple fabric seam. He considers where these delineations appear, why they develop, and how they are finally perceived.</p>

<p>With a piece titled Mimesis, 2013, Genovese merges a crack found in a Pompeii fresco with a line from Metallica’s …And Justice for All album cover artwork. By stitching these unrelated strands together, Genovese formulates a new pattern, but one that still reads as spontaneous as chance. The compound of seemingly disparate fissures subsequently reveals self-similar patterns, as in the logic of fractal mathematics. Therefore, variations in contour between unrelated sources are not as far removed from one other as they may first appear, and conceptually framed, what one assumes a chasm may actually serve as a suture.</p>

<p>JACKIE GENDEL - COMEDY OF MANNERS</p>

<p>Much of Gendel's recent work makes contradictory use of two of modernity’s most common conventions of image production; she employs both serial repetition of form and the sequential image of narrative, using them simultaneously to unfold the implied relationship between narrative time and painterly process. This achieves a “Groundhog Day”-like effect in which a scene repeats albeit in slightly altered scenery, and increasingly nuanced but appreciable differences occur in the who, what, when, how, and ultimately, most importantly, “why”.</p>

<p>This peculiar take on the incremental space within and between paintings provides an unlikely connection between Gendel's recent work and her early work derived from her background in underground comics, a medium of "sequential image" storytelling, which she drew in the late ‘90s for an upstart feminist webzine for teenage girls.</p>

<p>But her recent work is also equally established in her approach to easel painting, and specifically her play with the notion of character and historical time developed throughout her first exhibition of speculative portraits at the gallery in 2006, which the artist credits as an important turning point in her work, and has continued in various iterations since.</p>

<p>BERNARD PIFFARETTI - REPORT</p>

<p>For more than 30 years Piffaretti has expressed the virtues and contradictions of painting, pairing codes of modern abstraction with a strict conceptual methodology. By vertically dividing the canvas into two equal halves creating the right-side as the original and the left-side its copy, Piffaretti has shaped his oeuvre into a multi-perplexing paradox that runs the gamut of painting’s canon while forming the quintessential Duchampian question to the audience.</p>

<p>The rigor and restraints of Bernard Piffaretti’s practice is riddled with the interruption, or pause, from its initiating mark, the formal constant of the painted-vertical line, that equally connects and separates the whole of the canvas. The paintings’ conception prompts a metaphorical plurality to the viewer on the creation of the pictorial image, the role of thinking in form, and the questions of negation and reaffirmation of the act of painting through the systematic role of copying to once more reveal what was already known. Unlike many of his contemporaries relaying on the power of the mechanical reproductive image, and the objective truth as presented in the photograph, Piffaretti posits himself into the endless variation of form as a traditional painter, acknowledging his strong conceptual threading, the thoughts within his paintings, and their relationship to space and time bearing the weight of the artist’s infinite dualities.</p>

<p>DAVID ADAMO</p>

<p>One part of Adamo’s conceptual stance is to question the meaningfulness of objects and the ways in which we come to understand them, through playfully transforming materials and subverting their intended use and more recently, by their amplifications and reduction.</p>

<p>David Adamo’s current work involves the transformation of objects from everyday culture such as bicycles, doors and musical instruments. By way of these transformations, Adamo not only subverts the object's intended use, but also plays with their size and material. On the ground floor of the gallery, the artist has arranged a row of replica pencil erasers lined up on a long single shelf. These pencil erasers are made from clay and hand-painted so that they are indistinguishable from the real thing. Elsewhere a bicycle frame has been crafted out of wood, the rendering of a generic and practical object into a lavish but non-functioning one. This particular bicycle is taken from the design of Graeme Obree, which he called the “Old Faithful”, a radically designed bicycle which included parts from a washing machine. The original bicycle is displayed in the Riverside Transport Museum in Glasgow..</p>

<p>A thread running through Adamo’s practice is the narrative of the artist as a performer, as if the act of making is a staged and choreographed activity. The works in the show point to a fantastical narrative to what could have occurred previously or is about to happen in order for this arrangements of objects to have come about. In Untitled, a replica door of a typical European grand entrance-way is installed into the gallery wall, but it is brought down to 1:2 of the scale and the original more subtle tones of a Prussian street are replaced by a bright orange paint.</p>

<p>Burroughs was an innovative writer and artist in many media. A primary figure of the Beat Generation, Burroughs went on to deeply influence a wide swathe of culture and thought with dozens of books and hundreds of paintings, essays, spoken word performances and multi-media collaborations.</p>

<p>In 1981, Burroughs moved his home to Lawrence, Kansas, where he began to make shotgun art. He went on to develop a wide range of painting techniques. From 1982 until his late years, he prolifically created visual art. Burroughs’ work has since been featured in over fifty international galleries and museums including Royal Academy of the Arts, Centre Pompidou, Guggenheim Museum, New Museum, Irish Museum of Modern Art, Los Angeles County Museum, and Whitney Museum of American Art.</p>

<p>MATT BRAY - BEING AND NOTHINGNESS</p>

<p>Matt Bray’s abstracted figures draw upon personal feelings of alienation, using expressionist techniques to engage with the human body. Bray’s paintings occupy and explore the tensions between subject and object, figuration and abstraction and allows the paint to exist on its own terms.</p>

<p>Being and Nothingness brings together key works to date, from dark forlorn heroes and expressive portraits to a more fragmented figure. Colourful sci-fi inspired canvases see the figure transformed - trashy horror movie monster, neon zombie or dismembered android body parts, now form the subject for Bray’s immediate and impactful approach to painting.</p>

<p>KWANG LEE - WATER</p>

<p>In Kwang Lee’s paintings, the Berlin lakes and the landscapes of Davos shine in a mysterious light. This light is not an observed one, like the Impressionists’ object of study, nor an artificial mise-en-scène. Objects seem to glow from within. Their intrinsic essence shines through, making them look both familiar and strange. It is a perceived light which Kwang Lee brings to expression. Darkness robs her of the most important sense of a painter, and strenghtens her inner feeling for the hidden essence of things.<br>
On the smooth mirrors of the lakes, the artist sets this light in a dialogue with itself. The water surfaces form nature’s canvas. On them we observe, entranced, the reality surrounding us. Due to the refraction of light it appears new to us, in an unusual proportion. The water’s movement dissolves the static quality. Kwang Lee’s pictorial compositions direct the viewer’s gaze time and again to the still and yet stirring mirrors.</p>

<p>VHILS - DEVOID</p>

<p>The artist’s latest body of work will 
focus on the individual in relation to the overpowering force of urban environments and 
to the dominant noise created by the cities’ unidirectional line of communication. Devoid will culminate a series of projects executed in 
2012 in Shanghai, Paris, the favelas of Rio and Lisbon.</p>

<p>Vhils has been exploring the complexities of the relationship between the individual, the urban 
environment and the ideological framework that sustains it since first taking up graffiti in the streets of his native Lisbon and has since 
gained huge international acclaim. Like other 
graffiti artists, Vhils learnt how to “read” the city, how to navigate its main thoroughfares and 
back streets, assessing the potential to strike and leave a mark. Yet, he soon realised the 
proposition contained in the urbanised space of the city extended beyond its physical 
territory, comprehending a vast cultural domain with ideological edifices rooted in the media, 
advertising, the designs of consumerism and the projection of public space.</p>

<p>JANNIS KOUNELLIS</p>

<p>Renowned for his pivotal role in the development of the Arte Povera movement in the 1960s, over the last 50 years Kounellis has continued to rede"ne artistic practice through his original use of materials. 
His works, which might be seen as a combination of painting, collage, installation, ‘environments’, performance and theatre, are made using everyday materials such as soil, coal, stones, hessian sacks, "re, live animals, bed frames and doorways, as well as objets trouvés. These are imbued with dramatic power, stimulating memory and a sense of history, as well as the reality of our present day experience, to express the underlying tensions within contemporary society, and the multiplicity and fragmentation of its language.</p>

<p>During the 21st century, Kounellis has developed an increasingly architectural vocabulary, typified by the labyrinth he constructed in the main hall of Berlin’s Neue Nationalgalerie for his 2008 retrospective. Working in dialogue with the Mies van der Rohe designed building, the structure served as a complete environment in which to exhibit examples of his earlier works. His exhibition at Blain|Southern has been created in a similar vein, with the sculptural installation responding to the gallery’s vast, post-industrial space.</p>

<p>DANIEL ARSHAM - REACH RUIN</p>

<p>Connecting the lines between art, architecture, dance, and theater, Daniel Arsham mines everyday experience for opportunities to confuse and confound our expectations of space and form.</p>

<p>Arsham is known for subverting existing architectural structures in unconventional, playful ways: façades appear to billow in the wind, figures seem wrapped beneath the wall’s surface. His cross-disciplinary practice, historical inquiry, and satirical wit combine into an ongoing interrogation of the real and the imagined.</p>

<p>PAULE HAMMER - INTERVIEW MAGAZIN 2</p>

<p>The focus of this show is on a series of interview pictures that the artist created by inviting old and new friends and acquaintances to his atelier to sit for a portrait and discussion session.
The artist’s own dreams as well as larger world-encyclopedia-like issues on the problems facing humanity had previously provided the starting material for Hammer’s motif-and-text-filled pictures, which combined personal experiences with stories from friends and media information. But now, in the intimate atmosphere of a portrait session held in his own atelier, the artist opens himself more than ever before to his subjects’ personal dreams, experiences, desires or theories about the world and humanity in general - yet always within the context of a straightforward social situation that forms the basis for this close exchange.</p>

<p>Landscape painting, the still life and the portrait are just some of the traditional art history genres that intentionally underlie the artist’s works. But Hammer takes these genres, surpasses their limits, and creates an expanded reference field. So they are not limited to representing familiar local situations or individual human characteristics, but transgress the limits of their own forms: ”Surpassing forms does not mean … breaking away from forms, alienating oneself from their location. To validate the formless does not call for non-forms; instead, it is about agreeing to work with forms.”[2] Two factors are behind the specific dynamics in Hammer’s works: the elimination of the rules governing traditional representation and the use of different contexts.</p>

<p>PERIENNE CHRISTIAN</p>

<p>Perienne Christian layers images with archetypal myth, she maps eclectic territories and depicts natural landscapes bearing the marks of personal history and family heritage. Translating modes of representation -observational sketches, found photography, Victorian maps, press cuttings - into the levelling media of pencil, paint, or intaglio etching, she holds open spaces for contemplation. Christian’s psychogeography resonates with Blaise Pascal’s view of nature, as “an infinite space whose centre is everywhere, whose circumference is nowhere.” This is, equally, an apt description of a draughtsman’s world, in which hand and eye coordinate through deft line, sensing and recording depths of meaning in the angle, proportion, and tone of each branch and crag, figure and creature. As the conventional configuration of space and form is turned inside-out in images such as Crescent Moon Bear (2012) and Siberia Irrational Representation (2012), we are given permission to pause at each element - rich with a quavering touch - that speaks to our own stories, dreams and desires.</p>

<p>These intimate images are also the subject of Phantasmagoria, an ambitious work-in-progress, so far comprising eighty new drawings on paper depicting other people’s dreams. Psychoanalyst Melanie Klein described the unconscious as a “theatre within,” a stage on which the characters of our inner world perform. In Christian’s universe, these characters, emblems, and motifs are certainly diverse, and rely upon multiple layers of interpretation, from the participant’s take on the question of “dreams” to the artist’s translation of their words into images. Arranged in a grid format, the 8x10cm drawings display pictorial slippage across a collective fantasy space: wolves and dogs surround submissive humans in several sketches; still water and waves fill others.</p>

<p>YE NAN- LIKE MOTHS TO A FLAME</p>

<p>The title of the exhibition Like Moths to a Flame comes from Ye Nan's musings on the phenomenon of moths flying into flames. In scientific theory, the phenomenon is a result of the insect's built-in celestial navigation. Moths rely on their inherent compound eye structure to determine their direction in relation to moonlight. However, when an artificial light source appears, moths misidentify the artificial light as moonlight and fly towards it. A nearby artificial light is of course no celestial moon. Instinctively trying to maintain a constant angle with the light source, a moth flies around the light in a spiral trajectory, circle after circle, until it dies of exhaustion; or it flies into the flame. From a scientific perspective, the act of moths flying into flames is purely instinctual; on the other hand, in a literary sense, there is deep pathos. Though it appears to be a rather stupid suicidal act, the moths' immolation perpetuates the species' phototropism, which could be just the meaning of living for moths.</p>

<p>In this exhibition, Ye Nan combines his creative process with the principle of moths flying into flames, as if to signify some sort of inner connection between his work or this exhibition and the spirit of moths. He covers the canvas surface with red phosphorous, turning the canvas into a large matchbox striker. He then strikes matches on the canvas like magical paintbrushes, creating light and energy in the dark. The energy leaves its traces on the canvas, forming an image within the painting frame. The whole process is akin to producing an artificial light that attracts moths to the image, constructing a scenario between the real and unreal. It is worth mentioning that human intervention did not ever cause moths to forgo their nature, in relation to Darwin’s theory of evolution. For the artist, none of these interpretations is important, what really matters is to embody the spirit of moths in the pivotal moment when trying to achieve the sublime, as flame turns into ashes.</p>

<p>ANTONY GORMLEY - MODEL</p>

<p>Made in direct response to the space of the South Galleries is the vast, new work Model, which is also the title of the exhibition. Fabricated from 100 tonnes of weathering sheet steel, the work is both sculpture and building, human in form but at no point visible as a total figure. Visitors will be able to enter the work through a 'foot' and journey through its inter-connected internal chambers, the sculpture demanding that we adjust our pace and bend our bodies to its awkward yet absolute geometry. The experience of this analogy for the 'dark interior of the body' is guided by anticipation and memory and the direct and indirect light which penetrates the structure and which leads us on, as if through a labyrinth.</p>

<p>The central corridor of the gallery will hold new sculptures built of solid iron blocks whose uncompromising orthogonals belie their emotional punch. Propping up the architecture, articulating a corner or lying flat on the ground, these dark works test the bounding condition of the space. Their sculptural language is highly reduced, in some cases so schematic that the body form is rendered purely abstract, but without any loss of human empathy.</p>

<p>The exhibition also features a selection of Gormley's working models, installed on a series of tables. Revealing processes that can be both playful and disciplined, the installation suggests a workshop full of ideas and procedures, methods and materials.</p>

<p>WILLIAM KENTRIDGE</p>

<p>South African artist William Kentridge’s eight-channel video installation I am not me, the horse is not mine will be showcased in the UK for the first time in the Tanks at Tate Modern.
Projected simultaneously across the walls of the Tank, each film is played on a continuous loop to create an immersive audio-visual environment, which resists the establishment of a single narrative.<br>Each short film contributes layers to a story that references Russian modernism, from Soviet film of the 1920s and 1930s to the calamitous end of the Russian avant-garde.
Kentridge grew up and continues to live in Johannesburg, where his parents were lawyers involved in the anti-apartheid movement. Informed by this background, Kentridge often addresses the fraught legacy of apartheid and colonialism through innovative use of charcoal drawing, printmaking, collages, stop-animation, film and theatre.</p>

<p>RICHARD KOPPE - GYROSCOPIC</p>

<p>Even before he came under the spell of the New Bauhaus in Chicago, which he attended and subsequently joined as faculty, Richard Koppe (1916-1973) was a consummate modernist. An intense and imaginative formalist, in the mid 1930s he was already dedicated to the play of shape, color, and composition, and the nature of the serial variation. This set of preoccupations, common to a whole generation of American abstract artists in the mid-century, would guide Koppe his entire life, through flirtations with Surrealism and Expressionism, as he worked in many different media, including drawing, painting, sculpture, printmaking and design. Koppe's early work was deeply involved in a highly stylized species of American Cubism, drawing on his studies at Chicago's Institute of Design with Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Gyorgy Kepes and Alexander Archipenko.</p>

<p>STANLEY WHITNEY - YELLOW, NOON AND NIGHT</p>

<p>The title of the exhibition, which is also the title of one of Whitney’s paintings, is, like most of his paintings, inspired by music, poetry and his love of reading: In this case by a blues song called Morning, Noon and Night. For the title Stanley Whitney simply replaced the word “Morning” with “Yellow” to introduce the aspect of colour. And the title also emphasises rhythm as a parameter that is essential to Whitney’s work: Whereas rhythm is central to Jazz and Blues, it is the colour that makes the beat in Whitney’s paintings.</p>

<p>Colour is what structures the paintings. For a long time Whitney has been working with square canvasses of different sizes, which he structures with up to four unequal bands consisting of one or more lines the width of a paintbrush. Starting from the top left–almost like writing a text–he fills the bands with a series of non-uniform rectangles and squares of different colour. This process, which ends at the bottom right of the canvas, can be repeated two or three times. The choice of colour is intuitive and the result of the painting process which is unpredictable an unknown.</p>

<p>Whitney works with the system of “call-and-response”, which is a principle used across multiple disciplines, and in music is typical in spirituals, gospels, blues and jazz. He paints one colour and then decides which colour responds to the first one. This very simple principle results in the fact that the same colour is almost never used twice and the colours become more and more complex.</p>

<p>MATTHEW STONE - LOVE FOCUSED LIKE A LASER</p>

<p>Love Focused Like a Laser highlights a new series of wall-based works created using computer controlled engraving and a new form of photography that captures moving bodies lit only with lasers. During the long exposure shots, Stone moves in front of the camera and "draws" directly with nightclub lasers lights onto the bodies of the performing figures. The camera tracks the movement of the models, the artist and the lasers resulting in spectacular imagery that combines photography, performance and drawing.</p>

<p>These pieces are part of Stone's continuing explorations of the body and spirituality in our contemporary experience, promoting an optimistic reimagining of human potential. They push his explorations forward via his creation of luminous creatures and spectral bodies that emerge from a process that is defined by community-minded collaboration and embedded within the technological language of our times. Inspired in equal part by shamanism and avant-garde nightlife activity, Stone gives image to his philosophy that the nightclub might present a secular context for sublimated and intuitive religious experience, a statement that is reasserted in the works' installation.</p>

<p>PETER BLAKE - ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS</p>

<p>The show features almost 50 new and previously unseen works from the past six decades. The exhibition title takes the idea from the children’s game, and provides a framework for the sections sculpture, works on paper and collage.</p>

<p>In his sculpture, Blake continues to assemble found objects, with surreal scenes and narratives. ‘A Parade for Saul Steinberg’, started in 2007, resembles a New York street parade, where famous cartoon characters and other fantasy figures march in recognition of the cartoonist Steinberg; one of Blake’s artistic heroes. Popular characters from Blake’s earlier works reappear; Snow White is seen showing-off her garden of underwater debris to René Magritte, whilst elsewhere 30 of her dwarf companions lead an invasion of a bagpiper’s Swiss chalet.</p>

<p>In addition to using plastic, readymade characters, Blake constructs figures from natural materials including a miniature army made from bowling balls and stained wood, adorned with medals and badges to represent military achievements. Another sculpture built from wooden objects is a life-size family group posing beneath a driftwood tree, and this two-metre-high sculpture will dominate one of the galleries. As a departure from his constructions of found objects, in a new group of works Blake presents six found objects as works of art in their own right, reminding him as they do of sculptures by Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and other twentieth-century masters.</p>

<p>MIKE NUDELMAN - SEEING THINGS</p>

<p>Nudelman's meticulous ballpoint pen drawings take Earth and outer space landscapes as a starting point, filtering sources through various historical ways of viewing: painting, stereoscopy, telescopic photography, and screen-based media found on the Internet. Each work is built up with thin layers of diagonally drawn iridescent marks. The artist's hand scans the surface of the paper from the lower left corner to the top right leaving thousands of marks the size of small hairs, gradually building an image.</p>

<p>Among Nudelman's sources for the images in this exhibition are reproductions of pictures by Hudson River School painters Frederick Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt, former-astronauts-turned-artists Alan Bean and Alexei Leonov, and NASA photographers using the Hubble Space Telescope. Some images are cobbled together using a combination of these sources depicting seemingly unbelievable, serendipitous phenomena. The images often appear closer to movie stills, simulations, or dreamscapes, than anything naturally occurring. These supernatural images exist primarily on the virtual plane where time and space are malleable constructs and the sublime is more a feat of engineering than happenstance.</p>

<p>KIKI SMITH - MOMENTS OF CLARITY</p>

<p>For the exhibition Moments of Clarity Kiki Smith has created a group of new works of art that examine the issue of sources and communication of artistic inspiration. The American artist, who has been regarded as one of the great contemporary artists since the late 1980s, examines the theme from all sides in the wide variety of media characteristic of her.</p>

<p>Ideas are often as stubborn as shy animals. They retreat when you reach for them, won't come when you call, and refuse to be lured at all. But at some point, without your having done anything, they are abruptly there, calm and quiet, yet suddenly clear and sharp. Smith has already explored the essential experience of such moments of clarity in earlier works under a decidedly feminine perspective. In Smith's Munich show, this image recurs in a more universal form. Here, light serves as a metaphor for illumination, enlightenment, the breath of life per se.</p>

<p>One of the show's recurrent motifs, which succinctly sums up the notion of the happy idea, is the light bulb, for Smith is fascinated by its archaic, simple, energetic, yet simultaneously fragile form. The rows of girls and women lined up beneath the rays of paper lanterns in Assembly have the facial features of the artist's friends and assistants. They tell us that the artistic idea is not simply a gift of some sort, but has to be worked for by co-existing with one another in society. This also includes the possibility of failure, for which Smith has invented a concentrated image - that of the broken Lightbulbs made of blindingly white porcelain and manufactured at the Nymphenburg porcelain factory.</p>

<p>SAYRE GOMEZ - SLIPPERY</p>

<p>LA conceptual artist Sayre Gomez will debut his innovative and challenging works in a major exhibition that will include painting, sculpture, drawing and installation. Through his iteration of imagery and subtle shifts in material and presentation, Gomez explores a very digital sensibility in relationship to image making in the 21st century, while updating tradtitions of oil painting and bronze sculpture. Recent shows at Las Cienegas Projects and a solo with Kavi Gupta in Chicago this year have shown Gomez to be a great new and critical voice in the young art scene.</p>

<p>CHESTER ARNOLD - A PILGRIM'S PROGRESS</p>

<p>For Chester Arnold’s solo exhibition, the artist presents new paintings rooted in imagery of the west - grand landscapes scarred by the work of miners, stratified and marked by history: geological and human. Metaphorical narratives and occasions for contemplating the duality of the human journey unfold on the painting’s panoramic stages. The binary sides of our emotional experiences, dark and light, are present in each work.</p>

<p>The title of the exhibition, A Pilgrim’s Progress, references a Christian allegory written by John Bunyan and published in 1678, The Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which Is to Come. It is regarded as one of the most significant works of religious English literature. The paintings in the exhibit convey the artist’s personal journey through what he calls “the disorganized religion of art.” “As the secular madman that I am, there is a constant, inescapable commentary staring back at me from the Judeo-Christian pollution in my early life. I love the stories, but deplore the dogma.” Arnold’s painted imagery also grapples with transitions and the passage of time (perhaps his own aging) through depictions of elderly men, skeletons, and the heavily chiseled chasms in the earth. Arnold’s tenebrous mood in the paintings is tempered by passages that are also humorous and light, providing visual reprieve and a bit of optimism in the ponderous, larger narratives.</p>

<p>JOYCE PENSATO - YOU GOTTA DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO</p>

<p>Working largely in black and white, and often with signature images drawn from comics and popular culture, Pensato is an exuberant expressionist painter. A native Brooklynite, she has lived and worked in the borough for her entire career. Over the last ten years Pensato has slowly but surely garnered an international reputation for her darkly provocative and often poignant paintings.</p>

<p>In this exhibition Corbett vs. Dempsey will present a group of brand new paintings, including images of Groucho Marx and South Park Kenny, as well as a startling new batch of painting collages, a new facet of her oeuvre. These bold and explosive works often begin as splatters from her canvases, migrating onto other surfaces in her studio, which are grafted together into photographic assemblages featuring the likes of Muhammad Ali, Marlon Brando, and Al Pacino.</p>

<p>MUSEUM OF CURIOSITIES</p>

<p>The Museum of Curiosity is inspired by the ‘Wunderkammern' of Renaissance Europe; collections put together by wealthy, well-travelled patrons that sought to represent a microcosm of the world by drawing together diverse and wonderful objects from natural history, religious relics, historical and archaeological artifacts together with works of art.<br>
It is in this tradition that gallerist and collector, Mike Snelle has created The Museum of Curiosity; his own 21st century Wunderkammer, replete with his personal edit of 'weird shit' from the natural world (a human skeleton, a Walrus’ penis bone beautifully carved with thirteen human skulls, the tusk of a woolly mammoth, a selection of early medical instruments, an ice age wolf skull) alongside specially commissioned works by artists he has unearthed on his voyage of discovery into the art world.</p>

<p>FRANK AUERBACH - EARLY WORKS 1954 - 1978</p>

<p>Frank Auerbach, Early Works 1954 - 1978, will feature 
eighteen works from private collections, oil paintings and charcoal drawings, some not seen for over thirty years, including portraits of some of the artist’s principle sitters, such as close friend and fellow artist Leon Kossoff, the model Juliet Yardley Mills, and Estella Olivia West.</p>

<p>Born in Berlin in 1931, Frank Auerbach was sent to England to escape Nazism in 1939. He studied at St Martin’s School of Art from 1948 to 1952, the Royal College of Art from 1952 to 1955 and also attended night classes run by David Bomberg at Borough Polytechnic. It was during this period that he developed an enduring friendship with fellow student Leon Kossoff. He had his first solo show in 1956 at the 
Beaux Arts Gallery in London, where he continued to exhibit regularly until 1963. 
From 1965 onwards he has exhibited at Marlborough Gallery. His work features in major public collections including the British Museum, National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Tate and the V&amp;A in London, and the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York.</p>

<p>HARLAND MILLER - OVERCOMING OPTIMISM</p>

<p>For Harland Miller’s first exhibition in Scotland, Ingleby Gallery presents a group of new paintings alongside a selected survey of the artist’s work across several years. Common to all of these paintings is a basic structure of shape borrowed from decades of Penguin paperbacks: a motif that automatically suggests a very British kind of nostalgia, but which Miller turns back on itself with invented titles that prove the dictum that you can’t judge a book, or a painting at least, by its cover.</p>

<p>WILLIAM N. COPLEY</p>

<p>In the paintings on view, which span over a quarter century of CPLY’s career, the artist marshals the visual language of American patriotism to create riotous works full of wit and colorful pomp. A field of stars and stripes vignette a comely reclining nude, the Washington Monument becomes a bathroom stall tableau for CPLY’s own symbolic scrawls, firecrackers and unlit matches embrace in a kiss.</p>

<p>As a painter, writer, gallerist, and publisher, the artist blazed a singular path through numerous territories of post-war art, along the way charting a vital link between the European Surrealist and the American Pop Art movements. CPLY believed that “what [Surrealism] was always meant to be in terms of painting (more so perhaps than even Breton realized) was an opening of doors to the poetic possible through which contemporary art was going to penetrate." CPLY expanded on this idea of poetic penetration in the realms of contemporary art through his Patriotic paintings.</p>

<p>ANTHONY LISTER - UNSLUNG HEROES</p>

<p>For his all-new show, Anthony Lister - consistently described as “Australia’s best contemporary artist” – has used his sketchbook featuring portraits of hip hedonistic revellers, drawn at revels he’s attended, for inspiration. The elegant and sophisticated figures in the paintings - also dubbed the ‘Party Life Series’, may be a contrast to the obnoxiously intoxicated international youth of today. But this is exemplary of the artist’s most consistent theme: “I try to combine the highbrow and lowbrow,” says Lister, “creating analogies which allow the viewer to feel comfortable with subjects that maybe they’ve made snap judgements on before.”</p>

<p>On a surface level the content of Unslung Heroes marks a departure for Lister. The artist’s past trademark has been paintings of super-powered ‘grey paladin’ characters indulging in louche behaviour, more inclined to shoot laser beams from their sexual organs than their eyes or gauntlets. “The super-heroes I always described as ‘misguiding role models’. Well, the characters in Unslung Heroes are the products of those bad role models. Also this whole show is about people without super-powers who influence us. Super-heroes are just people in costumes after all.”</p>

<p>GREG ROOK - SURVIVORS</p>

<p>In 1975, when Britain was seemingly grinding to a halt, with political upheaval and economic gloom threatening financial and social collapse, the BBC broadcast the incredibly successful series ‘Survivors’ (1975 -77). Based on the premise that a global pandemic could leave only a few thousand survivors in the UK, it explored the practical and political implications for a group of individuals attempting to survive and ultimately rebuild society. The concepts of self-sufficiency and commune living were extremely current both in the UK and in the US, where there are still survivalist groups and families who choose to disengage with contemporary aspiration and act ‘as if’, culture-crafting and story telling - anticipating an imminent collapse of society and constructing their lives according to this premonition.</p>

<p>New paintings by the artist Greg Rook explore the historical stasis brought on by the post-apocalyptic scenario depicted in the TV series 'Survivors', and the chasm left by potential futures once imagined. In his work, the English landscapes depicted are corrupted by the post-apocalyptic imagery rooted in us by twentieth century history, and the literature, television and cinema influenced by this two-way slipstream of history and fiction. His practice explores the politics of apocalypse: the right focuses on the battle and the final show down that will, in the final triumph of the conservative impulse, return the earth to the state it occupied at the beginning; the left focuses on a New Age, where there will be no final battle, only a glorious transition to a future of sheer bliss. In this system there is no evil, only the perception of evil and therefore perception is all that there is to change. The right wing imagines perfection only in the past, the left in what’s to come.</p>

<p>RACKSTRAW DOWNES</p>

<p>Downes paints from observation, creating his paintings on site, from start to finish. As a consequence Downes moves with the seasons: April through October in New York and November through April in Texas. The paintings in this exhibition are equally divided between the two locations.</p>

<p>Downes says he chooses a site because it satisfies a “personal need” or has a kind of magic, but whatever his reasons are, he seems to choose sites that challenge him as a painter and that remain devoid of narrative, rhetoric and cliché. In this exhibition, the chosen locations of his Texas paintings include a graveyard, (as in two paintings titled Remains at the Site of the Old Military Cemetery, Fort D.A. Russell, No. 1 and No. 2), a local, outdoor dance floor (as in Outdoor Dance Floor, Presidio, TX) and simply the vast, expansive sand hills (as in Presidio: In the Sand Hills Looking East with ATV Tracks &amp; Cell Tower and Presidio: In the Sand Hills Looking East with ATV Tracks &amp; Cell Tower).</p>

<p>Similarly in the New York paintings, Downes goes for the ordinary, rather than the extraordinary, with the same tenacious detail. In the pair of paintings, Under the West Side Highway at 155th Street, Looking South and Sand, Gravel and Mulch: NYC Parks Dept. Facility at 155th Street, Downes captures the largest vista possible: the maximum distance in front of him as well as to either side. His comprehension of space is equal to his attention to time. Downes paints AM paintings or PM paintings, sun paintings or rain paintings always true to a specific light and exact time.</p>

<p>JACKIE GENDEL - COMEDY OF MANNERS</p>

<p>Much of Gendel's recent work makes contradictory use of two of modernity's most common conventions of image production; she employs both serial repetition of form and the sequential image of narrative, using them simultaneously to unfold the implied relationship between narrative time and painterly process. This achieves a "Groundhog Day"- like effect in which a scene repeats albeit in slightly altered scenery, and increasingly nuanced but appreciable differences occur in the who, what, when, how, and ultimately, most importantly, "why".</p>

<p>This peculiar take on the incremental space within and between paintings provides an unlikely connection between Gendel's recent work and her early work derived from her background in underground comics, a medium of "sequential image" storytelling, which she drew in the late '90s for an upstart feminist webzine for teenage girls.</p>

<p>But her recent work is also equally established in her approach to easel painting, and specifically her play with the notion of character and historical time developed throughout her first exhibition of speculative portraits at the gallery in 2006, which the artist credits as an important turning point in her work, and has continued in various iterations since.</p>

<p>ULF PUDER</p>

<p>His masterly paintings of architectural structures are devoid of human life and hover between abstraction and representation. Puder places chaos and quietude side by side. Symbols of human creation, industrialization and desolation are rendered in extreme perspectives, in front of dimly hued skies. Puder's scenes induce a sense of calm disorder, or animated stillness, perplexing and haunting as they appear to the beholder.</p>

<p>A member of the Neue Leipziger Schule, Puder gained international acclaim for adding an experimental surrealism to East-German Neo-Realism. In this large-scale work, architectural modules are about to collapse, alluding to turmoil and despair in society. Motif and title both set the link to the iconic The Raft of the Medusa by French painter Théodore Géricault, which depicts the conversion from men into cannibals due to the basic human instinct to survive. Puder's works pose questions to our society and its relationship with the past.</p>

<p>DORMICE - PRINCIPLE 54</p>

<p>‘Principle 54’ is the first time Dormice have exhibited the 
paintings that the pair have kept for 
themselves rather than distribute through galleries. Dormice’s 
paintings are heavily influenced by the international style media and 
often use its high-impact cover pictures for  inspiration, contrasting 
these images’ own augmented reality with dreamlike background 
vistas. In other instances Dormice transpose the sybaritic visual 
language of 21st century lifestyle photography into their own adaptations of iconic paintings, 
such as  Manet’s Olympia and Déjuner sur L’Herbe. “It is intended as if Manet, for 
example, were alive and painting these pictures today,” says one half of Dormice, 
Heinrich Nicolaus. The artists’ contemporary contrasts are arresting to say the least, 
ret-conning the historical shock value of the original paintings.</p>

<p>The exhibition’s title ‘Principle 54’ refers to a clause in the artists’ own working charter. 
“Our ‘principle 54’ states that we should do the opposite of what we are ‘supposed to 
do, going against the flow, stealing from other artists and directly including their work 
in ours,” says Heinrich. By glorifying high fashion and the commodification of the 
female body, or comparing modern pornography to the erotic work of master painters, 
Dormice provoke the more priggish elements of the metropolitan art scene. Equally, 
they provide a red-blooded celebration of contemporary living. “We are just here, like 
animals, living the moment,” say Dormice of their work and their process which they 
compare with making music: spontaneous and joyful but with grooves and melodies 
that are not only designed to appeal, but also form idiosyncratic and memorable 
compositions.</p>

<p>IVAN SEAL - IN HERE STANDS IT</p>

<p>Ostensibly working within the tradition of the still life, Seal’s small-scale paintings complicate orthodox depictions of the inanimate objects with which we surround ourselves. His body of work constitutes a lexicon of sorts, a vocabulary of matter brought to life. At Spike Island, the paintings are shown alongside computer-generated sound works, whose structure and rhythm are akin to the flow of canvases on the gallery wall.</p>

<p>Seal’s subjects sit in shallow, ambiguous spaces often demarcated only by a gradual shift in colour or shade, or a simple horizon line. These settings often share their colouration with the objects they contain, suggesting a non-natural light source, while in others the objects clash dramatically with their lurid backdrops. Though recognisably of this world, Seal’s subjects are painted quickly from memory, and as such represent less the depicted object and more the unstable, psychologically-inflected territory within our minds.</p>

<p>Sculptural qualities, such as weight and gravity, are undermined by the ambiguity of the space and the materiality of the paint itself, which shifts in successive works from thickly layered crusts to thin washes of colour. Much of the pleasure of this work derives from the physicality of the paint on the surface and the sense this carries of the work’s rapid execution.</p>

<p>RAYMOND PETTIBON</p>

<p>Densely hung across the walls, the drawings involve Pettibon’s characteristic integration of disparate imagery and fragments of handwritten text lifted and adapted from myriad sources. His style shifts fitfully within and between the works, ranging from graphic line drawing in charcoal (for instance, a rapidly crosshatched Bible) which invokes his early cartoons, to expressionistic and painterly forms executed in combinations of gouache, acrylic and crayon.</p>

<p>Pettibon’s chaotic agglomerative method is equivalent to the ‘cut up’ technique adopted by Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs in their book The Third Mind (1977). In an extension of this methodology, certain of Pettibon’s recent works literally employ collage. In No Title (Re-up periscope), pornographic excerpts from different drawings mass together into a bustling orgy, while a scribbled cartoon of a gun being discharged provides a comic superscript.</p>

<p>JEFF KOONS - HUMANKIND BEFORE ALL</p>

<p>Neither Koons nor his art can ever stay static : his oeuvre is like a quivering organism, ceaselessly buzzing with life, producing ever new and more surprising, vivid forms.<br>At Almine Rech Gallery, Jeff Koons is presenting a selection of seventeen works from the past two decades of his production ; recent, and less recent works will be brought in together with brand new works : works from the Celebration (1994-), Popeye (2002-), and Hulk Elvis (2005-) series, will be seen with a few works never yet seen in public, such as a pair of paintings from the artist’s latest series Antiquity (2009-2012).</p>

<p>There will also be new works or hybrid works that combine elements from these past various groups. In many ways, then, this exhibition at Almine Rech offers a crisp and precise selection and a summary of some of the iconic paintings and sculptures that have come out of Koons’s studio, and, at the same time, it introduces a ‘new, new, new’ Jeff Koons, one who, ironically, looks towards the dawn of humankind : the exhibition offers us a juncture between past, present and future, but also enables us to penetrate deeper within Koons’s ever more fascinating, and effervescent universe.</p>

<p>SHEPARD FAIREY - SOUND &amp; VISION</p>

<p>Entitled Sound and Vision, the exhibition title is taken from the David Bowie song of the same name. Bowie has been a major influence on Fairey, because he was able to master music and visual presentation with equal virtuosity. Music is an artistic medium that Fairey reveres almost more than he does visual art. He comments: “Music is visceral, but also has the additional powerful layers of the lyrics, with their content and politics, and the style, politics, and personalities of the musicians themselves. No matter how much I love art, or try to convince myself of its relevance in society, the fact remains that music is much more able to reach people’s hearts and minds.” The artist hopes to be able to induce in people, even a fraction of the emotion that hearing a new song or listening to a familiar one can evoke.</p>

<p>Sound and Vision, will incorporate a diverse array of mixed media works, which embody both the political and social influences on Fairey’s work, particularly that which is directly inspired by music. It is not only David Bowie, but also the Sex Pistols, Roxy Music, Gang of Four, the Clash and Metallica which have had an impact on Fairey’s work. To encourage viewers to experience an interaction between music and art, the artist will provide records from his own collection as well as customised vintage turntables to enable viewer listening. This section of the show is complemented by a display of eighty works which have the same 12x12” dimension as an LP sleeve. The artist will therefore use both sound and vision to connect with his audience.</p>

<p>MATT JOHNSON</p>

<p>Working with traditional media including bronze, stone, wood, steel and aluminum, Johnson's work utilizes materials that are synonymous with strength, belying the delicate, sensuous, and sometimes weightless appearance of the sculptures themselves. Objects seem to be poised just so, however fragile in their disposition. The work focuses on the physical point at which an object, when standing on its own, becomes a sculpture. Notions of classicism abound, from bronze drapery, to polished marble as well as a kinship to wabi-sabi and mono no aware. The spirits inhabiting or occupying these objects are pushed to the forefront, often bringing into question exactly what the viewer is looking at.</p>

<p>IAIN ANDREWS - MYTHOPOEIA</p>

<p>Manchester based painter Andrews has created a series of works, under the collective title of Mythopoeia, in direct response to some of the historic paintings on show at Warrington Art Gallery.  The museum’s curator writes‘In putting together this show we set out to facilitate a dialogue between specific works in the Museum’s collection and contemporary painting practice. A non verbal conversation between the past and the present that involves a conscious listening to and re-examining of what has gone before with the hope of arriving at some new understanding of that which has become familiar.’</p>

<p>In collaboration with the writer Joanne Reardon Lloyd, Andrews has found ways of exploring and retelling the original paintings. The narratives of Folk and Faery Tales with their themes of oral greed, synaesthesia and transformation feature heavily in the works, as do the experiences of Andrews’ work as an Art Psychotherapist. There is a limited edition catalogue available, with essays by the painter Graham Crowley and art critic Edward Lucie Smith.</p>

<p>JULIE OPPERMANN</p>

<p>Julie Oppermann’s recent series of paintings explore the contemporary idea of interference in relation to how information is disseminated, transmitted, and ultimately perceived, using painted moiré patterns created by overlapping multiple layers of nearly identical line patterns. Drawing from her background in Neuroscience, interest in perception and cognition, and study in Color Theory, her brightly colored, scintillating paintings recall the psychedelic, while maintaining a strong conceptual rigor. Oppermann’s systematic and rule-based process is matched by her impulsive and intuitive approach, resulting in uncanny, often unsettling decisions that set up compelling tensions within the work. The exhibition will present works ranging from very large paintings on canvas to medium sized works on aluminum and monoprints on paper highlighting Oppermann’s investigation of materials within her particular process.</p>

<p>JOHN MILLER - THE PETRIFIED FOREST</p>

<p>John Miller has produced a varied oeuvre that includes painting, sculpture, photography and video. With empathy, humour, and insightful observation, Miller plunges into the maelstrom of everyday life to distill the commonplace and the "normal". While a lot of Miller’s previous works had to do with the interrogation of value in a capitalist society and the disparities between the price and the meaning of something, his more recent projects offer at once critical and poetic representations of emotional affect, its relationship to bio-power and its impact on individuals.</p>

<p>For Miller, television remains primary source of mass cultural representation. Their muted pallet of greys and browns removes the images from the tacky glimmer of the mass media and renders them as handpainted artifacts. A few years ago, while executing a series of paintings depicting game shows (1998-2000), John Miller focused on the colorfully designed sets contrasting with the seemingly interchangeable participants. Clearly demarkating itself from this type of programming, reality television claims to focus on individuals and real life, but Miller chose to represent the moment when it all collapses.</p>

<p>GEOFFREY TODD SMITH - LOOKER</p>

<p>Smith employs seemingly simple structures in his work. Common geometric elements, circles, ellipses, ovals and dots - inhabit a tight grid in visually confounding and colorfully explosive compositions. In addition to his signature intricate and intimate gel pen patterns atop gouache-painted shapes, Smith has begun to experiment with a variety of surfaces and paints – adding texture, dimensionality and glossy enamel - in a new series of paintings on panel.</p>

<p>Within Smith’s colorful, fetishistic surfaces lurks a devotion to the challenges of abstract beauty and its ability to confound expectation and provoke desire. Smith searches, meanders and daydreams to find vibrant and colorful discoveries to entice the audience, of which he is also a member. Each composition is treated like a game with self-imposed rules and limitations regarding color and form. Though there is a grid present, its rigid structure and predictability operates as a foe to Smith’s often erratic and unplanned compositions.</p>

<p>MAGNUS PLESSEN - RIDING THE IMAGE</p>

<p>Known for his paintings that oscillate between abstraction and figuration, Plessen’s new body of work focuses on rotation as the means of re-ordering the relation of the viewer to the painting.</p>

<p>These new paintings simultaneously feature figurative elements that are ostensibly recognisable – hands, heads, feet – combined with abstract passages that serve to re-structure order and dimensionality within the painting, creating a palpable sense of disorientation. This effect is reinforced by a deliberate illogicality; representational aspects of body parts are fragmented and disembodied, elusive and transitory, unbound by any particular viewpoint or frame of reference. This is combined with added or subtracted sections of paint to imply spatial depth within the image, such as curved bands, which suggest dynamic rotation or movement. As Plessen notes, ‘For me, the key to understanding inner and outer space in painting is the space of the revolving door; at its centre there is no one looking back at you. The line between inside and outside is indifferent to appearances.</p>

<p>SERBAN SAVU - OVERVIEW</p>

<p>Overview explores the daily realities of life in Romania after the end of Cold War and opens a window into the lives of present-day Romanians. Savu draws with ease from classical European pictorial traditions - his works show a remarkable sense of observation matched by a subtle handling of color and geometrically rigorous 
composition. In some of Savuʼs painting there is a willful tightness to the realism, while in others a delicious touch of early impressionism.</p>

<p>The scenes, the people and activities look familiar and strange in the same time, thus demonstrating the anonymity of an 
existence perpetually at the brink in the vast sociopolitical machine. Often, the favorite Savu scenes are set outdoors. In response to the false grandeur of the former Communist era, Savu paints buildings and industrial structures, which often represent imposing vestiges of that time, then he pursues to decorate their surroundings 
with quiet grassy landscapes, thus colliding the pastoral with the industrial. Another favorite theme in Savuʼs paintings is the solitary figure, usually a worker who dominates his or her setting. The mood and purpose are consistent and there is a sense of alienation that transgresses every image.</p>

<p>MARC SEGUIN - MY CENTURY</p>

<p>Using charcoal and oil on raw canvas, Séguin achieves near photographic grisaille images that read as "postcards of now".  Unabashedly tackling hot-button issues such as economic disparity, human rights, and environmental exploitation, Séguin’s large-scale paintings are deceptively beautiful reflections of the era in which they were produced.</p>

<p>The artist's brazen approach to image-making frequently pairs his exquisite renderings with unexpected appliqués like taxidermy animals, rhinestones, tar and locks of hair to create bold motifs that bespeak our contemporary climate. Lunging road-kill coyotes, tar dripping from their fangs, flank a young woman in My Century, We are safe as long as the poor have faith - a siren for social injustice. My Century, Biutiful Smog and My Century, Biutiful Wilderness play with our assumptions of natural beauty as billowing clouds, soft with velvet greys and kohl blacks, are actually the products of smog and the burning of natural resources.</p>

<p>OMAR CHACON - BACANALES TROPICALES</p>

<p>Chacon’s signature droplets of color-saturated paint return smaller, more concentrated, and brimming with energy and color. At the start of each painting, thousands of acrylic ovals are prepared, then peeled and collaged onto canvas. Taking advantage of the synthetic qualities of acrylic - its bright, slick sheen, and pliability, Chacon’s surfaces glisten with exuberant color, projecting a spirit of optimism with a nod to discovery, both in everyday life and in the surprising details of each painting.</p>

<p>Although his paintings are visually abstract, Chacon personifies each oval in the process of creating the individual elements of his compositions. Forming a synergy through color and commonalities between ovals as he composes his surfaces, Chacon’s paintings are a metaphor for a social gathering where individuals amass, swelling into an energetic conglomerate, enlightened by a diverse cultural mix. Bacanales, observed in the exhibition title and in the titles of his paintings, refer to the wild and festive spirit of the Greco-Roman god Bacchus as well as Colombian street vernacular for something that is optimal.</p>

<p>ANGELA DUFRESNE - PARLORS AND PASTORALS</p>

<p>In most instances, the paintings have been executed alla prima. Through these single, sustained sessions, Dufresne animates familiar subjects in unexpected ways, generating “cover” versions of her own as well as a sense of emotional urgency.</p>

<p>What begins as a riff expands, through layered association, to a dense, lushly symphonic scale. In Lady David-Rosemary Angeles in a Golden Swamp, the artist inverts the gender of Bernini’s biblical David, combining portraits of her mother and herself, and isolates the torquing figure against a backdrop inspired by an Albert Bierstadt landscape as well as trees from the Hudson Valley. An exploration of Tiépolo’s The Banquet of Cleopatra turns into Banquette Concerto with Head; the balustrade in the background of the original Baroque painting becomes a rope bridge, the table centerpiece a severed head, an exploratory mark Condoleezza Rice.</p>

<p>Dufresne’s investigations emerge not from fandom or homage but the impulse to inhabit known material and discover unexpected points of connection. In merging contradictory or improbable elements - Buster Keaton at a film screening of John Singleton Copley’s Watson and the Shark, for instance, Dufresne erases the lines between pop vernacular and fine art, spectator and performer, memory and imagination.</p>

<p>DANIELE BUETTI - GARCON, L'ADDITION!</p>

<p>Like in his earlier works, everything starts with photographic images. However, in this case Buetti reuses images, which do not derive from fashion magazines but from documentary photography. They tell from terror, war
and seemingly insoluble conflicts. Their cruelty and suffer cause dismay. Mostly, these images reach us only via private snapshots along intricate paths. The artist converts these pictures towards abstraction and thereby
extinguishes large parts of their information. Through the form of their new presentation and its underlying character, they nearly become icons. As before, Buetti irritates us with a sense for aesthetic arrangements and a
pretended enticing beauty.</p>

<p>The artist transforms the original motives in many production steps on the computer in such a way that their original content seems to disappear behind the aesthetic surface. Parts of the pictures are extracted and substituted
with coloured pieces in different sizes. Merely the outlines of the central figures and structures remain rudimentarily recognizable, although they are also segregated into little colour-segments. However, the intervention goes
further. The outlines are cut out with a laser contour cut, so that a mosaic-like surface emerges.</p>

<p>In most works, several figures are to be recognised. Without knowledge of the original image, the scenes are not discernible. Only indications remain. In the work „oh boy oh boy_V“, an image of a prisoner tortured by American
soldiers from Abu Ghraib in Bagdad remains unambiguously recognizable. As a result, incertitude arises in terms of what we see in all other works of the series. The title of the series pushes this ambivalence even further. As an
exclamation of surprise the German correspondence of the series title „oh boy oh boy! “ leaves open whether it is a remark of joy or, nevertheless, desperation.</p>

<p>CHEON PYO LEE - MEDIUM IS THE SAME</p>

<p>Lee persistently examines questions of medium and genre through a sensitive and personalized body of work. Medium is the Same employs Lee’s personal economy to create a narrative atmosphere, a space full of lingering tones, endless chatters and moody humor. As an expedition into the complexities of association and narrative, the exhibition comprises two floors with a series of surprises and inversions.</p>

<p>Taking on the dual character of both engine and vehicle, the exhibition allows one to move in and outside the workings of travel and trade. Each individual work espouses a particular approach to fabrication. Chinese Waterfall, Broom, and the altered clapping monkeys within Felicity, investigate the myriad forms of kinetic sculpture, through components such as; custom built gears, bill counters, conveyer belts, and appropriated figurines.</p>

<p>Comparatively, in the basement project space, Lee has created an installation focusing on the journey of a container ship as it dumps toxic waste across the oceans, without a destination or an owner. Within Felicity and Wave Patterns, Lee’s palette acquires a crisp plasticity, mimicking graphic and industrial prototyping. The stylistic differences between the two floors are dismantled in the fragmented debris spotting the wall pieces that double the exhibition’s title, Medium is the Same.</p>

<p>Exhibition runs through to October 14th, 2012</p>

<p>ERIC YAHNKER - VIRGIN BIRTH 'N' TURF</p>

<p>For the past two years Yahnker has been preparing his massive drawings and sculptures for this exhibition, and it represents the culmination of his recent explorations.  The works in this show range from meticulous, two-foot colored pencil and graphite drawings to towering ten-foot works on paper; from tiny sculptural interventions to massive three dimensional arrangements. The pieces en masse form a lyrical and disturbing poem - which takes the title Virgin Birth ‘N’ Turf - about the state of the union and our contemporary American moment.</p>

<p>Yahnker is a virtuosically talented drawer who choses to take densely layered political commentary as his subject matter. The often large-scale pieces are visually seductive and can easily be appreciated at the purely superficial level, but after ingesting the title and contemplating the image for a bit, many more upsetting and controversial ideas begin to emerge. The works are elaborately planned and constructed to hold up to even the most intense conceptual scrutiny. There is a wealth of information and excitement to be had the more you meditate on each work.</p>

<p>ROMAN LISKA - NU BALANCE</p>

<p>Roman Liška's most recent body of work incorporates excerpts from the Financial Times Weekend Magazine's "Life &amp; Arts" section, from which it draws headlines including "Wealth Creations", "Chalet Girls" and "Risqué Business", as well as passages from "How To Spend It" (HTSI), the publication's insert that promotes luxury products aimed at the super affluent. In Liška's practice, advertisements for auctions of blue chip post-war art and the latest fashions from the world́s runways conjoin under semi-translucent, perforated mesh, are treated with spray paint rendered in a tie-dye aesthetic, and gain punctuation through eyelets that unmask layers of black cling film and newsprint bearing traces of the FT's distinctive rosé hue.<br>The formal determinations of these interventions extend the artist's investigations into the language of painting – problematising dominant models of the practice's limits while iterating shape, texture, and haptic engagement as contributors to painting's ongoing redefinition.</p>

<p>The ephemera of wealth creation, such as the FT and its sub-publication, act as barometers of the obscene logic of late-capitalist models of consumption in which seduction is a principle currency owing to its trade in the unceasing renewal of synthetic desires. It is in this arena that Liška's work activates an irresoluble tension: existing as an object whose aesthetic qualities contribute to its legibility as a commodity that operates dually in signaling the spirit of the contemporary while elaborating an implied critique of the very systems that sustain its production and distribution.</p>

<p>SUSUMU SHINGU - BEYOND TIME</p>

<p>The japanese artist returns with an exhibition of eight new mobile sculptures specifically created for the interior, together with a series of watercolours on paper.</p>

<p>A sculptor and researcher, Susumu Shingu creates sculptures that are often monumental, with movements generated by the forces and flows of nature - wind, water, sunlight and gravity. He also works regularly in other artistic disciplines with well-known architects such as Renzo Piano or Tadao Ando, as well as designers like Issey Miyake and choreographer like Jiri Kylian.</p>

<p>Starting out from scientific research on movement, based on observation of the nature of the human body and of nature, Susumu Shingu has created and installed several hundred wind and water sculptures around the world, all of them mobile, dancing, polyphonic and playful.</p>

<p>Exhibition runs from September 15th to December 1st, 2012</p>

<p>THOMAS SCHUTTE - FACES AND FIGURES</p>

<p>Over several decades, Schütte has created watercolours and drawings of acquaintances and friends, as well as many self-portraits, including the Mirror Drawing works. His drawings are often created in series, approaching the same subject numerous times as a means of engaging with the inner nature of the individual. Schütte’s drawings feed closely into his sculptural portraits, which are created in a similar spirit.</p>

<p>A work central to the Serpentine exhibition is Vater Staat (Father State) 2011, a towering steel sculpture of an authoritative figure who, paradoxically, appears frail and isolated. This formidable work relates to Schütte’s interest in shifts of scale; although epic, the work remains an investigation into fragility. Vater Staat resonates with the works placed outdoors in Kensington Gardens, the larger United Enemies sculptures; formidable yet anonymous figures, these are sited in the most public of spaces.</p>

<p>RITA ACKERMANN - FIRE BY DAYS</p>

<p>'Fire by Days', a title inspired by French poet Roger Gilbert-Lecomte's 'Vacancy in Glass', began as an accidental spill of paint on the artist's studio floor, which Ackermann mopped up using a Hungarian fire safety poster.</p>

<p>'These paintings came to me from, or as, an accident: suddenly the forms and shapes of hastily cleaning up a mess of paint on a surface suggested something that wasn't a figure or a face, but rather both, or abstract. This is how the first 'Fire by Days' images arose. I had no intention to make this picture. It was an accident.'<br>
 'As Paul Virilio once said, "Sublimation of the hunt…the course of painting imposes a cleared surface, a sublimation of war". The speed of the action demanded a pure surface in which I found the perfect image. To roll in complete freedom and depth in the desert; this is far more exciting than passing through a delimited course.' Rita Ackermann, July 2012.</p>

<p>ENDS OF THE EARTH - LAND ART TO 1974</p>

<p>Ends of the Earth: Land Art to 1974 is the first large-scale, historical-thematic exhibition to deal broadly with Land art, capturing the simultaneous impulse emergent in the 1960s to use the earth as an artistic medium and to locate works in remote sites far from familiar art contexts. Organized by MOCA Senior Curator Philipp Kaiser and co-curator Miwon Kwon, Professor of Art History at UCLA, the exhibition highlights the early years of untested artistic experimentations and concludes in the mid-1970s before Land art becomes a fully institutionalized category.</p>

<p>Rather than romanticizing notions of "return to nature" or an "escape from culture", the exhibition provides a comprehensive overview that reveals the complexity of the movement's social and political engagement with the historical conditions of its time. Ends of the Earth exposes Land art as a media practice as much as a sculptural one, focusing on the extent to which language, photography, film, and television served as an integral and not a secondary or supplementary part of its formation.</p>

<p>WADE GUYTON - OS</p>

<p>Over the past decade, New York–based artist Wade Guyton (b. 1972) has pioneered a groundbreaking body of work that explores our changing relationships to images and artworks through the use of common digital technologies, such as the desktop computer, scanner, and inkjet printer.<br>Guyton’s purposeful misuse of these tools to make paintings and drawings results in beautiful accidents that relate to daily lives now punctuated by misprinted photos and blurred images on our phone and computer screens. Comprising more than eighty works dating from 1999 to the present, Guyton’s first midcareer survey will feature a dramatic, non-chronological design in which staggered rows of parallel walls will confront the viewer like the layered pages of a book or stacked windows on a monitor. The exhibition will include paintings, drawings, photography, and sculpture, and will conclude with two spectacular new canvases, stretching up to fifty feet in length, which Guyton created specifically for the Whitney’s Marcel Breuer–designed building.</p>

<p>The title, Wade Guyton OS employs the common acronym for a computer’s “operating system,” linking Guyton’s art to the technologies of our time.</p>

<p>SARAH LUCAS - ORDINARY THINGS</p>

<p>Ordinary Things is a consideration of the ways in which Lucas uses the sculptural languages of the figure and the cast. Made by her own hand, her objects are produced through the languages that surround them, materials that are ready at hand, and sculptural procedures and traditions, taking in cutting, welding, moulding, handling, stuffing, assembling; monumental, ready-made, formal, quick-build, representational and abstract.</p>

<p>Lucas' sculptures are made of and from the human body - a decaying and sensible object that requires maintenance and care. 'Au Naturel' (1994) is a portrait of a couple on a bed, a man represented by a cucumber and a pair of oranges and a woman by a pair of melons and a bucket. Both vulgar compositions are constructed from materials and vernacular slang that are commonplace, their 'human' component made from organic matter that needs to be replaced as inevitable decay sets in. In the seven 'NUDS' (2009-2010) here on display, limbs can be seen wrapping around each other in knotted couplings and solo acrobatics, the cellulite-marked flesh formed from 'natural' tights stuffed with fluff and stiffened by wire, the delicate surface bruised and wrinkled as the bodies perch on their breeze-block supports.</p>

<p>ADAM GREEN - HOUSEFACE</p>

<p>In this exhibition, Green explores a reduction of cartoon imagery into modular sections and the evocative potential of their recombination. The works evoke the explorations of De Stijl and Mondrian crossed with the expressionism of his contemporaries like Joe Bradley, Ben Jones or André Butzer. Green's architectural inspirations range from Gaudí to Hundertwasser and many paintings specifically reference high density housing, water towers and airports.</p>

<p>Many of the designs are set upon a planar grid. Adhering to the horizontal and vertical laws of the grid - and with their evocation of eyes and mouths - they represent a fusion of the Neoplastic and animist ideologies.</p>

<p>SUSPENDED DISBELIEF</p>

<p>Suspended Disbelief, is a group exhibition featuring work by Marco Breuer, John Chiara, Yvonne Estrada, Dana Melamed, Antonio Murado, Mark Sheinkman, Joseph Stashkevetch, Allyson Strafella and Melanie Willhide.</p>

<p>The exhibition asks its audience to put its disbelief aside. Assembling works by nine contemporary artists, the exhibition challenges its viewers to accept a basic, though unlikely, premise about each piece in the show in order to fully engage in the work. Dana Melamed’s wall piece uses unconventional materials to create a sprawling urban landscape that couldn’t possibly exist in reality. Marco Breuer’s one-of-a-kind photographs are made without a camera or negative, while Joseph Stashkevetch’s detailed drawing is difficult to imagine as anything but a photograph. John Chiara and Antonio Murado offer their own unique take on landscape as Yvonne Estrada and Allyson Strafella’s intricate, abstract drawings are created using tools not often associated with the medium. Mark Sheinkman makes paintings with graphite, further blurring the medium’s boundaries with his subtractive, rather than additive, process. Melanie Willhide’s photographs of 50s pinup girls which once read like straight photography are now digitally sliced, mirrored and repeated in a playful demonstration of photography’s capacity for the inauthentic.</p>

<p>ALBERT IRVIN - FIDELIO</p>

<p>Irvin has chosen Fidelio as the title, for a number of reasons. There is his fidelity to abstraction, a consistent abstraction in which, over the decades, the artist has been careful to eschew figuration in any form. A S Byatt observed in a text on the artist, 'It is art about experiencing the world', adding, about the paintings' titles 'They are both arbitrary and not, a kind of notation of his life, street-names of London where his studio is... which have a resonance of their own'. Irvin has often referred to the grounding of his practice in the material circumstances of his own life. In an interview given in Dublin, Irvin said : "I don't want to depict or describe appearances - I want to make a kind of painting that is about the world rather than of it."</p>

<p>Fidelio is a musical evocation, echoing Albert Irvin's love for and great knowledge of the classics. Synthesising the proximity of music to painting, Irvin comments: "Music brought me to the realisation that it was possible to say what it feels like to be a human being without having to paint noses and feet."</p>

<p>FROM THE SUNNIEST DAY TO THE DARKEST NIGHT</p>

<p>This exhibition presents five artists from Eastern Europe that explore the relation between religion and violence.</p>

<p>“Whosoever spends sleepless moments in a bed in Sarajevo might hear the voices of the Sarajevo night. Hard and firmly strikes the bell at two o’clock in the morning in the Catholic Church. More than one minute passed (exactly seventy-five seconds—I counted) and only then was did I hear the slightly weaker, shrill sound of the Orthodox Church clock, also striking two o’clock in the morning. A moment later the sa-hat-kula spoke in a hoarse, subdued voice from the Bej Mosque, striking the eleventh hour—the ghostly Turkish hour, the strange timekeeping of distant foreign countries. The Jews have no clock, only the heavens know what time it is—whether according to Sephardic custom, or according to Ashkenazi. When all around is still and quiet, the difference separating men equalized by sleep is in the calculation of this hollow phase of the night. When they awake, they will be happy and sad, feast and fast by four different feuding calendars, and all their requests and prayers will be sent to heaven in one of four liturgical languages. The difference is sometimes visible and open, sometimes hidden and treacherous, but it always resembles hatred—this difference is often hatred itself.”</p>

<p>With these words the Bosnian writer and Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andric described Sarajevo—a town where four religions meet—in his short story entitled A Letter from 1920. Such places never know peace, as the confrontation between various visions of the world more often serve to emphasize differences, and not similarities. Meanwhile, political correctness notwithstanding, the idea of multiculturalism, so deeply rooted in European philosophy, will always remain a pious desire. This exhibition focuses on the ties between power, violence, and religion, and draws upon difference as a source of conflict: “The difference is sometimes visible and open, sometimes hidden and treacherous, but it always resembles hatred – this difference is often hatred itself.”</p>

The Dream Machine is an anomaly within the history of art, the only known artwork that is fully activated as the viewer closes their eyes. Taken as such, it suggests an evaluation of how artwork is viewed; its function, its value, and the language we use to engage with it.</p>

<p>Bringing together a wide range of practices, each artist investigates both the limits of set material conditions and ways of seeing by exploring physical mechanics, preconceptions of form and abstraction, and the relationship between the object and how it is perceived.</p>

<p>MR. BRAINWASH UK SOLO ART SHOW</p>

<p>Mr. Brainwash, the artistic alter ego of Los Angeles-based Filmmaker and critically acclaimed Pop Artist Thierry Guetta, is pleased to announce his imminent arrival to London where he will stage the setting for his first official UK solo art show.<br>
Mr. Brainwash will embrace the global art scene by taking over The Old Sorting Office, a colossal space centrally located next to the British Museum at the corner of New Oxford Street and Museum Street in London, during the Olympics this summer. The Old Sorting Office will act as a canvas for Mr. Brainwash’s latest original works in a larger than life exhibition that will be his first European show.</p>

<p>The show will comprise giant installations, murals, original fine art and many surprises. The artwork attributed to Mr. Brainwash emulates famous artistic and historic images, which immortalize popular culture and celebrate positivity.<br>
 Just like his previous art shows, this exhibition will be produced solely by the artist. In keeping with his motto "Life Is Beautiful" and "Never, Never Give Up", there will be no cost associated with tickets and viewers will be given complimentary posters, postcards and more. In the lead up to the show, Mr. Brainwash has already marked his territory on the side of The Old Sorting Office, which is merely a taster of what to expect</p>

<p>Exhibition starts August 5th, 2012</p>

<p>KEVIN APPEL - PAINTING</p>

<p>In his new work, Kevin Appel breaches new territory in exploring the tenuous relationship between the modes of photography, painting, and architecture and the incongruities that are produced at their collision.</p>

<p>As in earlier projects, Appel builds his compositions upon a narrative stream of constructing and dissolving architecture. For this series, he has moved from found photographs to those of his own, emphasizing his intimate relationship to the landscape in place of one mediated by an outside source. Appel's photographs are of the Salton Sea, a complicated space of utopian collapse and a failed site of sorts. The photographs function as the basis of each composition - large scale images are being printed with UV ink directly onto the canvases which have been prepared with a porcelain finish. Acrylic, oil and enamel paints are then layered in complementary ways, creating a complex correlation between the painted and the printed surfaces. Evoking a sense of ordered chaos, the reclaimed landscapes featured in the photographs break down into the essential patterns, tones, and textures of painting.</p>

<p>"Paintings" is an investigation into the connections between different visual strategies and the story of collapse that forms at their intersection. Rooted in photographs that are compromised and compressed by paint, Appel's current explorations evolved from the dissolution of the Pile Paintings from 2006. The exhibition pursues a trajectory of reassembly from that upheaval, where expanses of monochrome paint and intricate fields of textured abstractions push and pull against each other to shape a bittersweet optimism.</p>

<p>DAMIAN ORTEGA - TRACES OF GRAVITY</p>

<p>Furthering his exploration of man-made and organic systems and the transformative qualities of materials, Ortega's new body of work employs salt as a narrative and metaphorical device to examine notions of human intervention, exchange and play and the ways in which these are dictated by physical forces.</p>

<p>In the ground floor gallery, Ortega will present Congo River, a new installation consisting of car tyres placed irregularly in the centre of the exhibition space. Ortega has drawn a delicate line in salt along their surface to dissect the gallery. The drawing appears like a topographical mark taken from a map but could equally reference a line of cocaine. Ortega is interested in salt for its historical importance both as a method of preservation – particularly of meat – and as a powerful symbol of economic exchange, of which cocaine could be seen as the modern-day equivalent. The title 'Congo River' relates to Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness, as well as to Francis Ford Coppola's epic film Apocalypse Now, both of which use a journey along a river as a mythical and symbolic setting to examine notions of colonial repatriation, fear of the unknown and the 'other'.</p>

<p>SEBASTIAN GÖGEL - BOULEVARD</p>

<p>Corresponding to the real boulevard as a place of social interconnections and entanglement, Gögel's 'Boulevard' accommodates a cosmos of social prototypes in a telling display. Stylized portraits make their appearance next to abstract figurations. Radical attitudes and hierarchies are claimed and abandoned in his work. With hazardous intent, grotesquely morbid grimaces are united with blithely humorous elegance in a circus of crumbling beauty made up of urban facades.</p>

<p>Sebastian Gögel, born in Sonneberg, Thuringia, Germany, in 1978, lives and works in Leipzig. From 1997 to 2002, he studied painting/graphic arts at the Academy of Visual Arts Leipzig. From 2002 to 2005, he pursued his post-graduate studies with Prof. Sighard Gille.</p>

<p>TERRY NILSSEN-LOVE</p>

<p>Whilst the work from Terry Nilssen-Love over the last few years has moved in a more free direction, as opposed to the earlier more geometrical structured compositions, what has continually occupied him has been the search for a balance between order and chaos and how far to move in either of these directions.<br>
 Perhaps this is a natural problem he shares with many other painters as part of the process experienced whilst moving towards the "finished" work.</p>

<p>The question as to when a painting is finished is a difficult one to answer ?– the "final" brushstroke before signing the work is a myth perpetuated in novels. Perhaps a painting is finished when one simply stops in order to move on. Inevitably the next painting will be a continuation of the last, and therefore all paintings must represent a documentation of an ongoing process; so what is a finished and what is underway?
 Nilssen-Love  does not want to start and finish and then to start again. He works on several paintings at the same time. The dialogue takes place not only between him and a painting, but takes place also between one painting and another, or between several works.</p>

<p>The Europa Triangle is a group exhibition about how we imagine Europe today, explored through the work of ten international artists and designers whose work is concerned with public space and current affairs. Curated by Kit Hammonds, Tutor from the RCA’s Curating Contemporary Art MA, with additional contributions by students from the programme. The title of the exhibition refers to a motif present between all the works – triangles. This simple shape is used by the artists to comment on models for public space in society, politics and economics. Featured artists Oliver Klimpel, Marisol Malatesta, Nils Norman, Diego Santomé, Slavs &amp; Tatars, Christian Teckart, Lincoln Tobier, Daniel Wilkinson and Hannes Zebedin.</p>

<p>BOYD &amp; EVANS - VIEWS</p>

<p>In the first decade of their partnership, Boyd &amp; Evans made paintings from photographs in their own archive, spraying acrylic paint through stencils to create an even, thinly painted surface. Assembling disparate elements from different photographs allowed them to create new, mysterious compositions. Their paintings, while highly realistic, have a scale, composition and use of perspective that edges closely to surrealism; in these dreamlike pictures the air feels thin and time suspended.</p>

<p>Vision itself has been a longstanding concern for Boyd &amp; Evans, with many works suggesting the conditions of seeing or being seen. Views 1 and 2 (1973) show in the first canvas a girl with her back to the viewer, looking out toward a group of people and some cars parked incongruously in the distance. In the second painting she turns, as in a photographic snapshot, and smiles directly at the viewer.<br>
In the 1980s and 1990s, Boyd &amp; Evans abandoned the spray gun in favour of brushes, but continued to be inspired by photographic imagery, with an emphasis on landscape. In a number of works lone figures are set within sweeping, panoramic vistas traversed by railroad tracks and asphalt roads, ubiquitous traces of human industry and travel. Increasingly Boyd &amp; Evans have also shown an interest in pure landscape, devoid of human presence, a concern which developed while they were in Indonesia and the American Southwest.</p>

<p>PATRICK LUNDEEN - GOOD FOR YOU SON</p>

<p>Lundeen brings together seemingly disparate objects-from flags to rugs to posters to keyboards to grocery store dailies and magazine pages-into cohesive works resembling anthropomorphic masks. Neon-colored, kaleidoscopic patterns embellish six-foot tall cut out canvas masks, speaking to the artist's fascination with the exaggerated theatricality of Coney Island type characters, the Contemporary Macabre, and Outsider Art motifs. Borrowing from pop culture imagery and the neo-impressionists, the works hover between the humorous and sinister and the naïve and sardonic. Accompanying the exhibition is a 7" vinyl record by the artist's experimental three man rock band, The Oblique Mystique.</p>

<p>While Lundeen's musical influences range from the lo-fi genre, and improvisational acts like Hound Dog Taylor to the schizophrenic sounds of Daniel Johnston-it's a naggingly familiar tune by 80's crooner Rick Astley that drones from an old Casio keyboard in the piece, Together Forever. In the lo-fi, lo-brow Genie Amp, a vintage Fender Silverface amplifier functions as both pedestal and audio source for a booming silver-faced genie trapped in a T.V. declaring, "Behold, I am Silver Face!" The nostalgic nod is twofold. Despite the purposely brazen use of intentionally awkward elements, the work maintains a sense of authenticity and serves as homage to earlier American culture from before the artist's time.</p>

<p>ANTONY GORMLEY - STILL STANDING</p>

<p>In the ground floor gallery, Gormley has created an installation of 17 body forms, orthogonally arranged within the architecture of the gallery space. Each sculpture has been built up from a series of small, rectangular iron blocks; modular architectonic forms that diagrammatically map the body's internal volume, radically departing from anatomy.<BR>The works evoke imbalance and even entropy since key blocks in their visible support system have been removed and subtle displacements of weight mean that they are shifted from their own centre of gravity. Gormley has described these works as ’a kind of weaving of mass with void; a push and pull between blocks that are present and blocks that are absent‘. Poised in a suspended state, the works could be seen to investigate the verticality of the body, both in spatial terms but also in relation to the evolutionary trajectory of humans, progressing from an animal on all fours to an upright, cognitive being.</p>

<p>In the upstairs gallery, Gormley will present a single new sculpture from the ’Propper‘ series which further experiments with blocks as the fundamental basis for building or sculpture and uses the tectonics of post and lintel architecture - in the form of vertical and horizontal blocks - to translate body mass into the equivalent of a high-rise tower. Although these works appear like carefully constructed body-forms, their formation is actually more playful and free, reflecting the childhood game of placing blocks one on top of another, each time attempting to reach new levels of height and width before collapse and drawing attention to the eccentric loan paths of the build.</p>

<p>LUKE CAULFIELD - SECOND HAND</p>

<p>The artist’s latest series embraces the failure of historical documentation to relay the elusive experience of an object or event in its own time and place. Focusing on neon light works from the twentieth century, Bernini sculpture and the Mafia bombs that destroyed cultural targets in 1993, Caulfield reflects upon an anxiety to preserve the past, an anxiety to memorialize; instincts that seem to fight against the flow of time.<br>The synergy between Caulfield’s inspiration, perception and 
artistic portrayal is succinct throughout his body of work, both consciously and sub-consciously. His paintings play with and break a linear narrative and time structure. Much of the work is filtered through unconventional digital processes (2D and 3D), which allow digital "flaws" to add to the fallible texture of the documentation</p>

<p>PETER LAMB</p>

<p>The show will consist of works in several media all referring to the artist’s studio floor. In the work the studio floor is always the figurative starting point, acting as a ready-made abstract painting with incidental markings made from previous painting attempts.</p>

<p>By photographing the floor and mounting the image onto dibond aluminium it provides an optical double-take that positions the viewer in an impossible space. A further step towards abstraction is taken when Peter starts adding to the photo, either by painting or rubbing the work on the floor to make it pick up debris. Materials such as masking tape that form the figurative aspects of the photo are slowly phased out leaving just traces of recognisable imagery. Once the work is finished, Peter uses the uninhibited imaginative nature of his own children to come up with titles as they have a tendency to see unintended figurative forms in the abstract results. By titling the work with a reference to the figurative element, a journey is made between representation of reality, abstraction and back again, all within the confines of the spatial and thematic aspect of Peter’s studio. In the works in the show this process will be applied to photographs, canvases, large prints and neon.</p>

<p>DAN GRAHAM - URBANISM</p>

<p>The exhibition Urbanism shows Graham’s photographic works he has executed from the 1960s on, when he first came to New York City and also in nearby New Jersey, showing buildings dating from the early 19th century. These pictures are demonstratively ‘artless’ and focus the viewer’s attention on their content alone. The composition of the pictures plays with the prosaic structures of Minimal Art. Dan Graham demonstrates how these minimalist structures recur in everyday life, but are subsequently charged with social content. The spectrum reaches from mirrored office high-rises to serial housing developments with décor, kitsch and references to history being part of it.<br>Dan Graham takes Conceptual and Minimal Art from its usual context of the white cube and the desert and introduces it as integral part of cities and suburbia, shopping malls and living rooms.</p>

<p>EDVARD MUNCH : THE MODERN EYE</p>

<p>This exhibition examines the artist’s work from the 20th century, including sixty paintings, many from the Munch Museum in Oslo, with a rare showing of his work in film and photography.
Munch is often seen as a 19th-century Symbolist painter but this exhibition shows how he engaged with modernity and was inspired by the everyday life outside of his studio such as street scenes and incidents reported in the media - including The House is Burning 1925–7, a sensational view of a real life event with people fleeing the scene of a burning building.<br>
The show also examines how Munch often repeated a single motif over a long period of time in order to re-work it, as can be seen in the different versions of his most celebrated works, such as The Sick Child 1885-1927 and Girls on the Bridge 1902–27. 
Munch’s use of prominent foregrounds and strong diagonals reference the technological developments in cinema and photography at the time. Creating the illusion of figures moving towards the spectator, this visual trick can be seen in many of Munch’s most innovative works such as Workers on their Way Home 1913–14. He was also keenly aware of the visual effects brought on by the introduction of electric lighting on theatre stages and used this to create striking effect in works such as The Artist and his Model 1919–21.</p>

<p>PENCIL AND PAPER</p>

<p>This exhibition features works from Anna Barriball, George Condo, Nadine Fecht, Olivier Gourvil, Anthony McCall, Chris Ofili, Johannes Phokela, Michael Raedecker, Frances Richardson, Perry Roberts, Danny Rolph, Thomas Scheibitz, Michael Stubbs, Marcel van Eeden.<br>
It explores the power, subtlety, humour and ephemerality of the most basic of artistic tools: pencil and paper. It presents a selection of original and rarely-seen works, including two pieces created specifically for this show by Michael Raedecker and Chris Ofili. And it makes the case for these simple media, by demonstrating their limitless potential.
Pencil is often thought of as a tool for preparatory sketches. But some of those preparatory sketches have qualities to which the finished works could never aspire. Johannes Phokela’s exquisite contribution to the exhibition was originally intended a study for a sculpture of Atlas. George Condo’s ‘Don Pepito’ has a lyrical rawness, a swiftness of touch and a casual charm unique to the medium. Thomas Scheibitz’s piece is destined for its place in a full colour rendering of the same motif, but holds its own as an intimate doodle. Olivier Gourvil’s economical line in ‘Exploratrice’ describes an anthropomorphic object.</p>

<p>ERWIN WURM - ONE MINUTE SCULPTURES</p>

<p>Since the late 1990s Wurm has been developing One Minute Sculptures, an ongoing series in which we see the artist or his models pose in spontaneous ways with everyday items, inserting pencils in ears, propping chairs on eyes, and bringing a host of inanimate objects to life.<br>
Presented with both a good dose of humour and an underlying cynicism, One Minute Sculptures question the definition of sculpture, and wider issues about our consumer-focused society.<br>
“The fundamental steps consisted in abandoning the idea of durability and infinity. Sculpture could also last for just a few minutes, a few seconds. The works were transported to the level of the immediate present.” Erwin Wurm</p>

<p>MADGE GILL RETROSPECTIVE</p>

<p>Gill’s work has never been shown before in this way. She is presented not only as a defining member of the “Outsider art” movement (which denoted Gill’s status as a non-professional) but also as an important 20th Century artist whose work holds a modern audience captivated and intrigued.<br>This exhibition uncovers many patterns in her work which indicate her fragile mental state following a traumatic childhood (growing up an orphan, being sent to Canada as a child worker before returning to East London and marrying her cousin). Gill started to produce drawings and embroidery on paper and calico, but her adulthood was beset by the grief which it is believed inspired her work. After the death of her son from a bout Spanish ‘flu which lost her the sight in one eye, a stillborn daughter and finally the death of her husband, Gill was prolific in her production of sketches and drawings right up until the late 1950s. She died in East Ham in 1961.</p>

<p>EMER O'BRIEN - RETURN TO NORMAL</p>

<p>The exhibition consists of Barbara, an interactive sculptural piece, which visualises the relationship between sound waves and sound pressure, a series of live performance events and the accompanying documentation: film and sound recordings.</p>

<p>Based on the construction of a votive table, Barbara sends the vital spark, as flame and message into the ether; transmitting the ritual of votive offerings as sound. As a concept, Barbara offers a contemplative spectacle of fire and sound by enabling direct expression through simultaneous messaging between musician, instrument and audience. Like Hermes who was the mediator between the gods, and in whom hermeneutics’ etymological roots lay, Barbara is also a mediator; she is a listener and a messenger; she receives and she projects, otherwise put, she translates.</p>

<p>Where past work detailed the recent passing of time through documentation, the primary work in this case is the performance and the projection of time through the form of an event. By asking people to gather in the form of a ritual for the performance, the work questions the role of the audience in the production of meaning. By entering into the spirit of the piece, viewers contribute to the harmony and order of the piece, and through this semblance, make contact with the ultimate source of life: energy.</p>

<p>JEFF KOONS</p>

<p>This exhibition focuses on three central series of works - The New, Banality and Celebration - which represent crucial stages in Koons’s development and lead to the nucleus of his thinking and creative activity.<br>The New comprises the ready-made-like cleaning appliances of his early period, symbols of newness and purity. Banality includes those traditionally crafted sculptures in porcelain and wood which have since become (post-)modern icons. Finally, in the Celebration series, on which Koons has been working for almost twenty years, appear high-gloss steel sculptures of unique material perfection, and large-format paintings in which the artist celebrates childhood in a veritably baroque way. Koons’s equally spectacular and subtle works are repeatedly concerned with themes such as innocence, beauty, sexuality and happiness.</p>

<p>THE CHROME ANGELZ</p>

<p>Showcasing new and unseen work from arguably, Europe’s most influential graffiti crew. In addition, photography and archival work 
will be exhibited, providing audiences a rare insight into their unique history.</p>

<p>Member artists Mode 2, Scribla, Zaki Dee, Pride and Bando, will regroup for their debut exhibition to present new works, that epitomise their long-held commitment to creating a distinctly European aesthetic by way of the style, and enduring spirit of graffiti culture.  Paintings, drawings and sculptural works will be on display as part of the new series of works, alongside selected pieces from their archives that reveal the influence, and boundary-pushing impact of their early output.<br>
As the creative, yet provocative cultural phenomenon of graffiti art forced its way onto an unsuspected public in the early 1980’s, The Chrome Angelz (TCA) chose to draw upon their own experiences and creative influences, whilst proudly to acknowledging the culture’s rich and important history. As a collective, their shared interests in the visual arts resulted in a determined and singular commitment to creative expression, allowing them to freely determine a style and approach that was both personal and collaborative. The result was the creation of a number of high profile works that have earned TCA a place in the history of British graffiti art.</p>

<p>LIAM SPENCER PAINTING FROM LIFE</p>

<p>Liam Spencer is one of the North West’s most popular and successful artists.This is the largest retrospective of his work to date, but also includes significant new paintings of Salford, Rochdale, Oldham and Saddleworth.<BR>
Spencer was a key figure in the Manchester art scene of the 1980s and 90s and became well known for his urban panoramas, with their rich treatment of light and colour. Now based in Rossendale, his subject matter extends from the North West to as far afield as New York and Beijing.<br>The exhibition gives an insight into how
Spencer’s work has developed throughout his career, including early studies and experimental paintings, as well as preparatory sketches and photographs for current work.</p>

<p>NICOLE WITTENBERG - THE MALINGERERS</p>

<p>In an age of sound bites sandwiched by social media excess and information overload, Nicole Wittenberg's paintings are a refreshing antidote. Distilled down to their essentials, Wittenberg's work - whether her “Skype” portraits, her architectural interiors, or her landscapes, offers up a complicated contemporary universe reduced to a skeletal framework. Its elegant brevity is not dissimilar to symphonic variations on a theme: one frame, presented in a multitude of ways, a sure and pared-down message conveyed as directly and with as much brevity as possible.</p>

<p>Wittenberg’s subject reflects her fascination with, and personal experience of bohemia and high society. In works such as Countess (London on March 19th, 2011) , we are confronted by a decadent mask of aristocracy, gone awry - at once chilling and certainly enigmatic. Her version, as it were, of the classic Bunuel film The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie resonates well with viewers familiar with pulped news coverage of Lady Di’s final days; royalty obscured by the paparazzi’s repetitive and blinding flash. Ironic for a figurative painter there is a kind of facelessness here, a distinct remove and distancing from emotion which Wittenberg expertly captures; we cannot read the inner turmoil of her subjects, we can only conjecture.</p>

<p>WALDEMAR ZIMBELMANN</p>

<p>Waldemar Zimbelmann´´s paintings shift between painting and drawing, while the characteristics of drawing are of fundamental nature to his work. Sometimes using personal or anonymous photographic images as a point of departure, the artist devises a subtle, sensitive visual language that creates its subjects in an overlap of figuration and abstraction. Zimbelmann´s paintings emerge from a process of overpainting, which is reflected in his themes as the passing of a situation.</p>

<p>At times only hinted at, in Waldemar Zimbelmann´s paintings the silhouettes of people, animals, houses or landscapes lead to a conflation of shape, body, time and space, from which his surreal narratives emerge fragmentarily. Individual or group portraits of persons carrying out a silent (inter-) action in his compositions preside as shining and fading figures, their bodies address a shift between location and rootedness.</p>

<p>The texture of the painting and the three-dimensional paint application is critical to Zimbelmann´s artistic process: Based on different layers of paint, which accrue in the process of overpainting, a superposition of color and color planes develops, from which the artist renders his visual motifs by uncovering parts of these layers. The linear elements, often sgraffito, are finely drawn, almost resembling woodcut hatching, and are juxtaposed with a vigorous, sometimes extensive coloring, which brings vibrancy into Zimbelmann´s compositions.</p>

<p>MAIREAD O’HEOCHA</p>

<p>Mairead O’hEocha describes the phenomena of the garden centre as a simultaneously interior and exterior experience where a resultant distortion of the expected colour register occurs.  Normal and usually underwhelming forms; pots, plants, ornamental bird feeders, sprinklers and water features, etc. reinstate themselves in visually unexpected ways. In an intriguing and understated manner, they begin to undermine optical-to-intellectual conventions; pulling the rug from under the psychological and emotional implications of lessons learnt from Newton, Goethe and Itten, respectively.<br>  If in the real world, the colour wheel impacts upon our comprehension of, and feelings about things, how then does the physical alteration of a poly-dome – an artificial sky, fully worthy of Garcia’s trippiest moments, re-tune the garden centre’s captive surrogates of the natural world, plants, animals, nature, growth, life? What then does this say to us (and about us) as we return and re-populate the greater world – signified here by our almost universal passion for our gardens and the pastime of gardening – with its hybrid mutants, hanging baskets, hi-glazed planters and ceramic frogs?</p>

<p>WILL COTTON</p>

<p>Conjuring his signature land of plentiful sweets, for the touchstone of this group of new works the Artist depicts Katy Perry (Cotton served as Artistic Director for her 2010 California Gurls music video) as the reluctant queen of an imagined Utopia. In Crown, she stands before a palisade of pastel cakes, holding the headpiece as if wary of its obligations and consequences, realizing that a reign of opulence and profusion will inevitably conclude in decline and decay.</p>

<p>Cotton evokes the memory of a time before this awareness in Candy Forest, an idyllic landscape that merits bright color but is instead painted in the monochromatic palette of an old sepia photograph. Yet even in that distant past this Utopia harbored an underside - a truth underscored in the paintings Landfill and Trash Pile. Here, doughnuts, pastry, and tarts are nothing but layers in a garbage heap, their allure diminished in a realm of infinite riches.</p>

<p>STEPHEN WILLATS - SURFING WITH THE ATTRACTOR</p>

<p>London-based artist Stephen Willats is a pioneer of conceptual art and has made work examining the function and meaning of art in society since the late 1950s.  His first South London Gallery exhibition in 1998, entitled Changing Everything, brought together a body of work made in partnership with local residents over a two-year period.  Aiming to create a cultural model of how art might relate to society, the work invited visitors to make their own contributions to it, shifting the way the art institution relates to the world around it.<br>For his latest show, Surfing with the Attractor, Willats re-presents material from Changing Everything alongside a new installation featuring a huge ‘data stream’ spanning 15 metres and made in collaboration with 14 London-based artists.  Comprising hundreds of carefully ordered images in various media, the data stream documents two contrasting streets of London: Rye Lane in Peckham and Regent Street in the West End.</p>

<p>JASON MARTIN - INFINITIVE</p>

<p>In a daring new work, Martin has dramatically transcended the two-dimensional.  On arriving at the gallery, the visitor is confronted by the monumental, matt black, cubed block, Behemoth, measuring 3m x 3m at its base and over 2.6m high. Comprising layer upon layer of stacked virgin cork coated in pure black pigment, the squatting sculpture dominates its setting.  The work is impossible to understand in a single perspective and the spectator is forced to negotiate its sides and edges, unable to access its top.<br><br />
Simultaneously awe inspiring and intimidating, elusive and alluring, Behemoth accesses a shared primal memory: the Kaaba of Mecca, a mausoleum to a long dead dignitary, an 
inviolable alchemist’s box.  Initially solid and impenetrable, closer inspection reveals the 
gnarled, pitted unruly surface of the untreated, pigment-blackened cork, sourced from the area around Martin’s Portuguese studio.  Its natural undulations and inconsistencies echo the raw, worked, sculptural surfaces of Martin’s pigments.  The form of Behemoth, and its physical presence in the gallery space, echo the theatrical preoccupations of Minimalist 
sculpture but the ancient and organic nature of the material conversely alludes to an inherent human narrative that belies these conceptual concerns.</p>

<p>ALEXIS HARDING - SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT</p>

<p>The relationship between what has happened, and what has been done, is not always clear in Alexis Harding's work. Nor is the status of the material his practice corrals into place a clear cut question of cause and effect, or of the essential and the superfluously contingent. An awareness of questions of agency and possibility, the structures in which these occur, and the ways in which these react back upon one another are part of the disruptive but fecund power of his paintings.</p>

<p>Recent paintings demonstrate a technical approach in some respects unchanged from earlier work, but are offered up as a difference on another level, like the same sound caught by differently configured microphones. A gradated spectrum of gloss paint poured through a partitioned container and moved across a surface of wet oil colour on panel is a recent organising principle. These panels often take a regularised format, the 8' x 4' of a standard mdf sheet, or perhaps the circular tondo form. The upper skin of the paint in some of these works has left incremental ridges depending on interruptions of its journey across the surface, these ridges acting as a different sort of graphic trace to the initial frictionless pouring.</p>

<p>For this exhibition Namazi extrapolates on the themes he has been addressing throughout his practice: social structures and patterns, architecture, consumption and detritus. In two major new works he focuses on the urban landscape in the context of instability and failure.</p>

<p>Leaning Horizontal (2012) comprises a supermarket shelving system full of products. The sculpture is a Ready-made, though here it leans against the gallery wall at a 45-degree angle. Through this act he distorts our understanding of the object and renders it uncanny. The sculpture brings up issues around consumption, commerce, exploitation, existence and security. The sculpture leans against the wall like a painting - object becomes image.</p>

<p>SIMON MCWILLIAMS - SHOOTS AND LADDERS</p>

<p>Irish Artist Simon McWilliams brings his unique perspective on the urban landscape to the heart of Culver City's art district with an exhibition of his new paintings at Skotia Gallery. McWilliams takes his observations of the city around him and filters them through his bold, painterly imagination. What he delivers is a fictional developing city, housing mysterious forms cloaked with impasto paint, reminiscent of Christo’s wrapped buildings. Not a drab concrete city but a new optimistic metropolis, resplendent in abundant, tactile colours, promising, “a glorious morrow”.</p>

<p>Sound drawing and painterliness combine to produce a unique vision that is part fact and part fantasy. Dust clouds created by ant-like workers on vast scaffolds, glitter in the sunlight taking on ghostly appearances. Victorian palm houses burst with growth; a profusion of exotic plants and organic shapes, green shoots grappling and seemingly merging with the cast iron struts, the natural and the manmade conjoin, to harness and energize the environment.</p>

<p>JULIAN OPIE</p>

<p>The exhibition includes a striking series of walking figures, which have increasingly become an important part of the artist’s practice. Simplified to the point of becoming human ‘logos’, walkers in vinyl are displayed in an extended line, recalling Egyptian friezes. In an intriguing and radical development for the artist, he has captured unknown passers-by from the streets of London rather than working with personally known subjects. The unwitting subjects reveal themselves in movement, captured in the moment, exhibiting their own idiosyncrasies in the way they carry themselves. Walking figures are also captured as still images on inlayed granite and stone.</p>

<p>Opie’s choice of medium is key in drawing attention to the physicality of his portraits. Two major new bodies of work mark a technical departure for Opie and juxtapose modern and classical sources.  A group of mosaic portraits explore the relationship between sculpture and painting by emphasising the materiality of the imagery. This relationship is taken further in a series of painted busts on plinths in the same room, which beguilingly unite sculptural forms with flat imagery.  The busts are the result of the artist’s use of three-dimensional scanning, a meticulous process that involves laser scanning the subject’s head from various angles. The resulting image has then been simplified, formed and dipped in resin, and then hand painted by Opie. Though created using cutting edge technology, the busts are also rooted in traditional sculpture dating back to the Roman period and beyond.</p>

<p>BLACK MIRROR -  DOMINIC SHEPHERD &amp; JOHN STARK</p>

<p>Claude Lorrain was famous for using the Black Mirror as a painting aid, a small slightly convex mirror with a darkly tinted surface. The use of a blackened rather than an ordinary silvered mirror resulted in a somewhat weakened reflection, which stressed the prominent features in the landscape at the expense of detail. It also lowered the colour key. The painter would turn his back to the scenery and analyze the view through the tinted glass which had the effect of abstracting the subject from the world imbuing it with a painterly quality.</p>

<p>My intention for the exhibition Black Mirror is to create paintings that reflect this world through a different light. The figures depicted are often absorbed in intimate rituals with their back to the viewer, veiling the action and creating a sense of ambiguity where the beholder is free to question the meaning. The specific objective is to create paradoxical images that reflect the psychology of the viewer through their interaction with the mirror- like painted surface, and the subject within. I hope to achieve paintings that can be read as both cruel and compassionate, warm and cold, dark and light.  John Stark</p>

<p>MICHIEL CEULERS</p>

<p>Setting off from a blithe and basic beginning, Ceulers has spent many long nights with painting: stripping it down, lovingly caressing it, kicking it around the room, taking its bent limbs and girding them with humor and grace, manhandling the poor thing so that you can witness every bruise and tear, each scrape and scratch, the mystical sprays and the many whispering brushstrokes he's dragged across its long face. When they finally wander out of the studio to hang against the stark white walls of far-flunggalleries, the paintings bear all the marks of his love affair.</p>

<p>He strips the medium right down to its skeleton, peeling away all the unnecessary accouterments laden on poor painting by thousands of years to find out as best he can what the act can presently and personally mean. He endeavors to renovate the ancient practice with works wearing proudly their labors, sometimes singly and sometimes coupled together in handsome pairs. A rapid rigor reveals itself, unwinding through stripes and grids leaving the paintings at the end of the process curiously tender and refreshingly human.</p>

<p>KON TRUBKOVICH - LEAP SECOND</p>

<p>A new series of paintings, works on paper, and a sound piece translate psychological underpinnings through elegantly complex methods. The television static, weak transmissions, and tenuous connections he depicts suggest that somewhere behind all the noise and disrup- tion there is a broadcast confirming our existence and interconnection.</p>

<p>Prominent in the exhibition are a group of large-scale portraits of the artist's mother, culled from just one second of home video, which documented the final party she threw in the U.S.S.R before the family immigrated to the U.S. Defining a transitional moment of flux, these works illuminate the difficultly of tracing the past and express our elusive connection to the concept of origin. Through oil on linen, Trubkovich visually describes the sensation of relating to a person or physical location that no longer exists, or at least not as remembered, and aims to parse latent recall into a tangible codex.</p>

<p>As a continuation on the portrait series, in the sense that the imagery now becomes even less absolute,Trubkovich moves to embedding profiles of Lenny Bruce or the word “MAMA” onto backdrops of analog noise or “snow.” These monochromatic paintings feel more primal or subconsciously linked, presenting impossible transmissions. Weaving through a personal narrative, the contradictions arising between the seen and unseen serve as a chronicle of his imagined memory.</p>

<p>VERSUS - JAMIE BALDRIDGE AND BERNHARD BUHMANN</p>

<p>It’s the golden age of struggle: occupy everything; lex talionis; welcoming to the jungle. Acceleration and demise go hand in hand; the hamster’s wheel leaves no room for imagination and introspection.
This is what we need and this is what they do. Baldridge’s meticulously composed images assembled from hundreds of digital photographs. “Existing in a state of quivering dementia, swirling somewhere in a sparkling electric reservoir, waiting to be brought into the light of day”, the very personal darkroom of one’s unconscious abyss.</p>

<p>Buhmann’s magnum opus sucks the viewer directly into a narration, full of marvel and wonder, a parallel universe, an alternative reality, full of buskers and jesters, where rivers flow upstream and clocks go backwards, the irrational, the unexplainable. A place “where not only time is out of joint”.</p>

<p>Baldridge’s and Buhmann’s contemplative, at first glance almost unearthly approach to their respective media is very investigative, in subject and form alike. Their struggle is universal, their matters ubiquitous; the artist as the alchemist or the artist as a prophet.</p>

<p>Baldridge and Buhmann oeuvres are deeply rooted within art history. Hieronymus Bosch, as a very early example, where overall composition and detail are in constant dialogue, not only reflecting world views and belief systems, but deconstructing and reconstructing the semantics themselves. Inner urge as their impulse, friction as their motif. Fighting against, fighting with, fighting for. This is VERSUS.</p>

<p>FIONA RAE</p>

<p>In 2004, when Rae visited Tokyo and reconnected with visual aspects of her peripatetic childhood in Asia, her lexicon further broadened to include small figures or cartoons whose status is left intriguingly ambiguous. Like Caspar David Friedrich’s human presences in an overwhelming landscape, they serve to point up the metaphysical and artificial dimensions of abstract painting, whilst also providing an empathetic point of identification for the viewer that invokes a more personal reading.</p>

<p>In using elements that might be considered girlish or otherwise unserious, Fiona Rae looks to re-examine their meaning and expressive possibilities from what could be seen as a feminist perspective. In more recent paintings, these ludicrous yet gnomic images might be thrust into passages of expressive brushwork, layered and dense, or caught in black calligraphic drawing inspired by Dürer’s Apocalypse woodcuts, to produce dramatic and emotive compositions. Her recent titles often purport to be exclamations or statements, but like her paintings, they elude definitive explanation and can appear simultaneously dark and charming, anxious and insouciant.</p>

<p>CHRISTOPHER HANLON - DISSEMINATUS</p>

<p>In common with the Fairy Inkap Coprinus Disseminatus (a subject to which Hanlon has returned at regular intervals in his paintings) the artist's preferred support is organic matter - most usually linen stretched over wooden board – which has served a previous function and is found in a state of disuse, now ready to provide the breeding ground for a new and unfamiliar lifeform.</p>

<p>Mushrooms are essential - without them ground is not fertile and plants don't grow. Mushrooms are ephemeral - some species even grow over night silently and unseen only to disappear the next day in the rain. The Fairy Inkcap Coprinus Disseminatus, sometimes called the Trouping Inkcap or Trooping Crumble Cap, is a species that forms dense masses on rotting tree stumps and roots. These gregarious little fungi occur from early spring until the onset of winter, and they are at their most spectacular when the caps are young and pale - sometimes nearly pure white. It takes just two or three days for young white caps to turn grey and then begin blackening. Dessiminati will then scatter and broadcast their spores as delicately, mysteriously and as widely as possible, spreading spores almost like a rumour which gets more and more distorted as it circulates until its origin becomes unknowable and untraceable.</p>

<p>ADRIAN NAVARRO - REFLECTIONS</p>

<p>These large scale paintings, part of the two series Rings and Loops, are reflections in its two meanings, i.e., mental and optic or physical. Adrian Navarro puts in front of us a clear equivocation of figure and ground. The classic geometries of ring and helix are carved as reliefs with precise ambivalence -sometimes the circular holes are opaque, sometimes transparent, revealing their painted matter. These volumes are intermittently altering their own figure-ground revealing technique: they are themselves defined against a veiled ground of formless paint; the ring is self-contained, whereas the loop is an open-ended figure cropped by the frame of the canvas; both contain figures within them, and are the ground to their own figures as well.</p>

<p>What Navarro is presenting here is the Battle of the Paintings that has been taking place at his studio for the last half decade, three centuries after The Battle of the Books at the King’s Library - both in London. What Jonathan Swift satirized in 1704, was the quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns. The beehive and the spiderweb were the metaphors of that day. Today, the battle is that between: abstraction and figuration, craft and design, the eye and the hand, movement and confinement, and ultimately between totality and infinity. The work of Emmanuel Levinas of 1969 (Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority) finds in these series and in the gallery as battleground - its best pictorial equivalent.</p>

<p>MARIUS BERCEA - CONCRETE GARDENS</p>

<p>Bercea belongs to the generation of Romanians who grew up under Ceausescu’s regime, and saw their country’s rapid transformation after the dissolution of the Communist Bloc. In some of his earlier paintings, the artist tackled real and imagined childhood recollections: the formulaic school photographs, games, and picnics of faceless kids, wrapped in the yellowish, noxious air that hung over Eastern Europe after Chernobyl’s nuclear disaster.<br>With this new series, described by the artist as a “collective urban portrait,” Bercea deals with what happened immediately after 1989, with the arrival of Western capitalism; neon slowly taking over the cityscape, its fluorescent hues slapped on the decaying concrete, the shifting sense of what is normal, what should be aspired to, and how it could, or should, be obtained. Although it eschews direct narratives, Imperfect Pearls Shimmer at Dusk evinces a sense of being in flux. Advertising blurs progressively emerge from the brushstrokes’ rich interlays; Romania’s transition is happening on the canvas under our eyes.</p>

<p>LESLIE SHOWS</p>

<p>Shows initiated this body of work while in residence at the Bemis Center in the summer of 2011. Beginning with digitally scanned images of pyrite, Shows constructs and collages large-scale paintings on aluminum panels, with materials including ink, acrylic paint, Mylar, Plexiglas, metal filings, sand, crushed glass, and canvas. The works are spectral, reflective, and aim to accurately depict their object source, yet engage the alchemical mythology of the material. A second body of work includes a series of cast sulfur objects. Shows' casts of everyday forms—remotes, telephones, toys—conjoin cast-away objects with an element that is used heavily in industrial processes.</p>

<p>Shows has built deep resonance between the two series and a video work, The Cares of a Family Man(2012). The iron pyrite landscape works are illusory, artificial representations of fool's gold, an economically useless yet psychologically and historically charged sulfide mineral. In contrast the sulfur sculptures are chalky, a waxy opaque yellow copy of senseless objects. The Cares of a Family Man utilizes Kafka's story about an object named Odradek to illustrate the disorienting dimensions and unstable perceptive qualities shared by all her works.</p>

<p>JENNY HOLZER - ENDGAME</p>

<p>Entitled Endgame, the exhibition includes a series of paintings marking the artist’s return to the medium after more than thirty years.
Jenny Holzer searches for ways to make narrative a part of visual objects, employing an innovative range of materials and presentations to confront emotions and experiences, politics and conflict.<br>While looking for subject matter for electronics and projections, the artist located a number of redacted, declassified government documents including policy memos, autopsy reports, and statements by American administration officials, soldiers, detainees, and others, generated during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. These opaque documents became the foundation for Holzers silkscreened paintings in 2005; she began to create the fully handpainted works on show in the gallery in 2010. Color, scale, and the mark of the hand are the only alterations that the artist makes; the graphic geometric shapes are the censor’s, and the surviving text is original. Holzer’s subtle alterations exacerbate how much one isn’t allowed to see.</p>

<p>SCOTT MYLES - THIS PRODUCTION</p>

<p>This Production features significant new works including an expansive site-specific installation, new sculptures and a body of work produced with DCA Print Studio.</p>

<p>Displaced Façade (for DCA) is a dramatic new large-scale installation made from bricks that references built architecture and personal memory. Myles has created a brick wall separated into three segmented parts that align to appear as one complete structure depending on the viewer’s perspective. Analysis (Mirror) is a new sculpture consisting of bus shelters upturned one upon the other and painted with a highly reflective paint. An ongoing series of wall-based sculptures take their form from manilla document folders Myles himself uses in his studio. These have been enlarged to the artist’s height of 194cm, thus setting them in relation to the artist’s body while making reference to containers and systems of index.</p>

<p>IAN FRANCIS - 10,000 YEARS FROM NOW</p>

<p>10,000 Years From Now examines the fragility of this lifetime in contrast to geological timescales.<br>
Inspired by his fascination with the Internet and other technological forms of mass communication, Francis isolates popular scenarios from the present and examines their inherent fragility against collapsing architectural backdrops as they exist within digital formats. His latest body of work highlights the perilous nature of our constructed world and brings into focus the futility of our social legacy.</p>

<p>Francis continues to draw inspiration and raw material from cinema, pornography, street culture, and images sampled from the Internet, synthesizing these sources into a quasi-literal vision of the "mediated" landscape. Through his work he explores society’s obsession with popular culture and the detachment he personally undergoes in relation to this pervasive sense of societal collapse and impending apocalypse.</p>

<p>BRETT AMORY - WAITING 101</p>

<p>The compositions in the exhibition focus on Amoryʼs newfound relationship with technology, and the implicit freedom it allows in his work. Delving into documentation methods which new modes
of ambulatory technology offer, Amory experienced a metamorphosis in his painting preparation and application. With intimate, firsthand knowledge of the many ways that technology can affect the lives of those it touches, Amory explores the avenues itʼs opened up for him as an artist in Waiting 101.</p>

<p>Inspiration has never been so easy to manipulate and document. Amory expertly wields the tools available to him, with the intent of maintaining and evolving the series that has garnered
him international acclaim. Prior to Amoryʼs use of the camera phone, his process involved painstaking research and meticulous stake-outs at chosen locations. This was always with the hope of capturing a moment and individual suitable to his artistic vision. His compositions show a radical departure from his historical works in their obvious spontaneity, yet remain true to his unequivocally distinct technique.</p>

<p>ÍVAR VALGARDSSON - POWER LINES</p>

<p>In Power Lines Valgardsson continues his investigation into the materiality of art and his interrogation of ready-made materials. Here the artist presents his viewers with a medium that is familiar to nearly everyone, but at a different scale: generally we see these cables at a distance as part of the landscape, not up close as we see them here. Throughout his career, Valgardsson has used other custom-made DIY materials to produce works of a transient nature. In particular, he has explored the conceptual properties of paint as part of his research into the relationship between nature and the man-made environment, for instance, likening a stream of paint to a stream of water. Thus the power cables are part of Valgardsson ongoing interest in currents, both in the physical and the metaphysical sense.</p>

<p>Valgardsson scrutinises the aesthetics of the quotidian and as he has pointed out, power lines are an ordinary part of our environment: “They are just there.” Unlike the simple building materials and paint he has chosen for previous works, the power line is a phenomenon that is much more loaded, criticised itself as a blot on the landscape and as a symbol of a contested infrastructure. In this exhibition, Valgardsson strips the cables of their specialized function and uses them to create a three-dimensional drawing within the space of the white cube, thereby placing this industrial material into an aesthetic context.</p>

<p>MICHAEL DEAN - GOVERNMENT</p>

<p>Michael Dean's sculptures are either the perfect size to be carried or quote their surrounding architecture where they are then to be found lurking, propped against gallery walls. Made from cast concrete, the surfaces are veined and ridged, offering invitations to be touched. Tactility is an essential sculptural quality for Dean - he wishes us to first 'touch with the eyes, and then allow ourselves to touch with the hand'.</p>

<p>Government quotes from and transforms the Institute's galleries. The concrete floor has been covered with a thick, wool, wall-to-wall carpet, becoming something to touch, with the new surface changing the visual and sonic experience of the spaces. Instead of standing, the Institute's Information Assistants sit on the floor. The door handles at the entrance to the galleries have been recast as four forearm-sized sculptures, titled 'Yes (working title)' and 'No (working title)'. These flat, grey, concrete bodies leave themselves no choice but to touched, their patina changing as the raw, unsealed surfaces pick up the traces of each person's hand.</p>

<p>FARRAH KARAPETIAN - REPRESENTATION3</p>

<p>The images Karapetian mines reflect moments in our lived history at which overwhelming circumstances place the human character at the heart of a tragi-comic narrative. In the elaborate staging and exhibition of these prints, the artist returns to the position of the photograph as an a-factual object: color, markmaking, and time spent are revealed as the products of both choice and chance here, and the print itself is what one sees first, rather than its subject. The time it takes to expose each print - sometimes doubly or triply - is registered in the image, pushing the work into the conceptual place occupied by motion pictures.</p>

<p>Representation implies and includes abstraction: Karapetian’s work, though largely figurative, includes hints as to the codes of its own making and to the ideological codes of the mass-media as well. The pictures reveal iconic representational tendencies in contemporary photography and graphic design, which are employed to describe events with extra-experiential drama and clarity. By working with hyperanalogue processes and at the scale of everyday life, the artist shows us that re-representation offers the possibility of deeper, slower experience of potent moments in our lived history than is afforded by the fleeting jpeg disseminated online.</p>

<p>TAKASHI ISHIDA</p>

<p>This work documents a painting being created on the wall and floor of a room. The documented painting, however, is just one out of many that could have been produced. In this sense, the aggregate of everything that was not documented could just as well be the work. Indeed every time I released the shutter, I felt as though I was simultaneously photographing another line in addition to the one I had just drawn and captured. Perhaps because I was shooting the room from multiple angles, slightly different rooms seemed to branch off into many more different spaces. When continually considering how one might go outside the room, I remembered what Wittgenstein said about the man who is imprisoned in a room because he does not notice the unlocked door behind him.</p>

<p>The exhibition will feature new 16mm film works and a stop motion animation video, which was produced by shooting a white wall built in the artist’s studio for the work and painted continuously, over several months. Ishida explains that he thought of Wittgenstein, Zen, and Yosa Buson’s haiku, which begins with an absent bridge, while producing the new works.</p>

<p>TRISHA BAGA - ROCK</p>

<p>Named after the historical Pilgrim landing site in Massachusetts, the video installation Plymouth Rock sees Baga attempting to sympathise with it as a body that has been broken up. She considers how this degradation has happened both physically, as it has traveled, but also in terms of its subjection to layers of human meaning over time. The work consists of a video projected on to a collection of paintings and objects in close proximity to one another. Conveyed through various mediums, the piece will also feature other antagonists such as voice, the sea, lines and colours. Like the act of looking, the video becomes potential body, or carrier, for these disparate elements and forces.<br>Here Baga looks at how the 3D projection on top of the objects works to negate their real objecthood whilst the representation of the cardboard box above them only appears more monumental.</p>

<p>DAVID LYLE - MISBEHAVING</p>

<p>Lyle’s painstakingly reductive painting process is a very crucial element to the evolution of his final images. Each piece is rendered using only black paint and turpentine. Lyle begins his process by priming a panel with white gesso. He then paints a thin, rich, oily black veneer over the primed panel, slowly and systematically developing his images by removing some of the black paint with a cloth. In doing so, Lyle renders layer upon layer of various values of black paint resulting in his signature-style of luminescent works.<br>
In Misbehaving, we see how Lyle’s methodology combined with his acerbic wit creates an altered reality rife with cynicism
and bursting with mischief.<br>Lyle is impeccably faithful to the vintage photographs that inspire his work - until a point in
which he instills a cultural reference so familiar, yet iconoclastic, as to leave the viewer wincing, laughing, or really thinking, often it is all three.</p>

<p>NICOLA VERLATO - HOW THE WEST WAS WON</p>

<p>Verlato’s dramatic allegorical compositions are rendered with remarkable use of perspective, reminiscent of the Renaissance-era. The show title, How the West Was Won, refers to the culture clash between monotheism and polytheism throughout human history, a battle that the artist believes to be at the very roots of the development of western civilization. In Verlato’s words: “Figurative art is intrinsically related to a polytheistic attitude (cult of idols) while the monotheistic one prohibits graven images, as written in the bible. Monotheism clearly won in most aspects of western culture but polytheism still survives in pop culture.”</p>

<p>One of the paintings is inspired by a medieval legend in which a Christian knight kills a Pagan knight but is castrated by his victim in the process. This symbolizes the loss of “wisdom of the body,” when polytheistic cultures succumb to religious conversion and assimilation into monotheistic ideals. Verlato transposes this narrative into the American Wild West of the 19th Century in his painting Conquest of the West, where a cowboy representing the monotheist attacks a Native American woman, representing the polytheist, who exacts revenge just before she dies. This epic battle scene is the most literal interpretation of the exhibition’s overarching theme, although the connection is looser in many of the other works.</p>

<p>JULES OLITSKI - REVELATION</p>

<p>Widely regarded as one of America’s last classic modern painters, Jules Olitski (1922–2007) created brilliant color harmonies and chromatic shifts that became one of the hallmarks of Color Field painting. Olitski enjoyed enormous acclaim in the 1960s and 1970s, and in 1969 he was the first living American artist to be given a solo exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</p>

<p>Revelation: Major Paintings by Jules Olitski draws together more than 30 monumental canvases from public and private collections. The exhibition examines five decades of creative endeavor, ranging from the artist’s first essays into stain painting beginning in 1959 to his visionary last compositions in 2007. This glorious presentation highlights the series that define Olitski’s major advances: Stain paintings, Spray paintings, Baroque paintings, High Baroque paintings, and the last great series, titled "With Love and Disregard."</p>

<p>ANTONY MICALLEF - A LITTLE PIECE OF ME</p>

<p>A Little Piece of Me' consists of ten new examples based on his ongoing 'Head' series, each titled 'A Little Piece of Me' one to ten. Antony paints his Head pieces at the beginning of a painting process and is his way of getting his creative juices flowing, they serve as a way of capturings a certain sentiment - or vehemence.</p>

<p>Antony's relationship with the Head paintings is spontaneous, intimate and physical: "The end result is never known before I begin. The mark making creates the expression of the face, changing it with each stroke. I'm constantly picking up the canvas, turning it around, trying to control the drips and throwing it back down." The Head paintings endure a rigorous edit, and many are destroyed before they make it on to gallery walls.</p>

<p>CORINNE WASMUHT</p>

<p>Wasmuht is widely known for her large-scale, multi-layered oil paintings. Her work derives from an array of pictorial inventions, culminating in an aesthetic tension that aims to reconcile what the artist refers to as the “dualism of modernism,” a melding of representational and abstract structures in painting. The paintings’ images are generated from an array of abstracted and overlapping photographic imagery that Wasmuht sources from a combination of the Internet and her own personal photographs.</p>

<p>The images, both appropriated and her own, mine daily life, nature, science and art, fusing into staged abstracted productions. As Wasmuht describes her process, “In a film, one image is followed by another, whereas I pile the images up on top of one another.” Above all, her labor-intensive painting technique characterizes her work. She applies countless translucent thin layers of paint onto wooden boards that have been repeatedly whitewashed and polished, making her pictures shine and appear to be illuminated from behind while giving their surfaces an immateriality that is full of movement.</p>

<p>KENNY SCHARF - HODGEPODGE</p>

<p>For this exhibition, Scharf has created several new bodies of work that survey his particular aesthetic approaches and sensibilities. The show features paintings, sculptures, a Cosmic Cavern installation, and a customized Cadillac, as well as an opening night performance by longtime collaborator, Ann Magnuson.</p>

<p>As a child Scharf was fascinated by television and consumer culture. Sitting only inches from the television screen, young Scharf became obsessed with vibrant and surreal imagery of cartoons and low budget sci-fi films. Optimism oozed from these dewy forms of popular culture, reflecting an era when the medium of television was still new and shiny. The outlook towards the future during the 1950s and early 1960s was a lustrous one filled with invention, cutting-edge products, space travel, and an unabashed vision of a better life. Coming on the heels of World War II, the hopefulness of this era was authentic. Various new industries and the jobs they developed were flourishing alongside the comforts of peace and suburbia. There was an aura of progress and prosperity, creating a seemingly realistic expectation of eternal euphoria. This feeling of positivity unhinged is threaded throughout all of the works in Hodgepodge.</p>

<p>CARLOS CORREIA</p>

<p>Carlos Correia presents a meta-discursive body of work that, rather than addressing general issues, poses questions that are intrinsic to the painting practice itself, using the medium to question its (im)possibilities. In this exhibition any attempt to discover a thread aside from these suppositions will be futile, since the clues provided are eclectic and preclude the establishment of a linear narrative structure.</p>

<p>Those clues function as keys offered to the viewer, though unfortunately they are not master keys: they do not even open any doors. Take for example the paintings that refer more or less directly to the current economic crisis: the popular protests, colourless Greece, ostentatious Chinese power, and so on. Instead of adorning the current political and economic situation with any commentary, these works speak of the possibilities (or impossibilities) of painting to continue reflecting reality in a conscious and rel evant manner.<br>The exhibition title Survival refers to the artist's continued critical stance with regard to the painting tradition.</p>

<p>NANA DIX - COLOR ME BEAUTIFUL</p>

<p>The current exhibition “Color Me Beautiful” marks a turning point for Nana Dix from collage back to painting, an organic artistic development. After years of abstinence from the medium of painting she returns and showcases a developed stage. Whereas the former collages reflected the overflow of images and the unrest of our times, the monochromatic color fields of the current exhibition indicate a ruminant withdrawal, which can be regarded as an allusion towards the abstract paintings of Mark Rothko. Contrary to the latter one the works of Nana Dix also feature an intrusion of aggression into the otherwise harmonic color fields: The pale green color field of the painting “Three Dots” (2012) gets disturbed by three blood red paint splatters, which may remind the viewer of shooting wounds.</p>

<p>The ruminant effect and aesthetic of monochromatic color fields collide with the aggressive potential of action painting. If at first the artists introduces an untouched aesthetic of peace and meditation with the painting “Pale Pink” (2012), she immediately and consequently destroys this impression with the other exhibited paintings that are mutilated with paint splatters and drippings. The imagery Nana Dix has created moves between the poles of human existence, between rest and unrest, between gentleness and aggression, Eros and Thanatos.</p>

<p>HOLLY COULIS</p>

<p>In a collection of new paintings, Holly Coulis presents large scale still-lifes and landscapes in broad and subtle color. She cleverly employs the simplicity of traditional genres as a framework for a complex exploration of the language of painting. The work is simultaneously cerebral and emotional, playfully raising questions about our relationship to images while finding poignant tensions in an idiosyncratic sense of color, line, and material. Colors range from vibrant to murky, paint marks from elegant to gritty, and space from harmonious to awkward; the work embodies an unexpected sense of beauty that encompasses much more than visual affect. In both theme and execution, the levity of her work is always in play with a darker, more serious subtext.</p>

<p>In “Pink Flowers, Red Vase,” the vase appears on the verge of ever so gracefully tipping off the back edge of the table. While the under-painting serves to designate foreground from background, vase from table, the application of subsequent, vibrant layers of complimentary colors works to flatten that space and suspend our belief in the cast shadows. This peculiar push-pull is not uncommon in Coulis’ paintings, which draw upon a mix of influences as varied as cartoons, French painting and Pop. Similarly, the scale possesses both a stark monumentality and playful intimacy; an effect that is heightened by Coulis’ simplified edges and flattened shapes drawn, in part, from the smaller sketches that are her sources.</p>

<p>ELLEN BERKENBLIT</p>

<p>Berkenblit applies a distinctive palette of vigorously mixed colors with assertive broad brushstrokes and some scraping of the palette knife. Her shapes are rough yet well-defined fields of color; occasional black outlines can define an object, an animal, or the features of a face. Out of the paintings’ visceral physicality emerge certain themes, motifs and ideas: a head in profile featuring intense black lashes and long shimmering hair, lacey ribbons (painted as angular and deliciously awkward bands of paint that vigorously pull together the paintings’ fore- and middle-grounds). Even purely atmospheric sensations such as clouds, bolts of sun light, rainbows and starry night skies find expression. These images simultaneously emerge out of the subjects’ relevance and the visibly exuberant act of painting.</p>

<p>The paintings’ spirit is bold, boisterous and forceful, sometimes mysterious, always deeply emotional. The interplay between figurative elements, the intense atmosphere created by color contrast and tonal palette, as well as the compositional devices create figurative paintings of great fluidity and openness without being narrowed by narrative.</p>

<p>KYLE TROWBRIDGE - THE POLITICS OF TIME</p>

<p>For several years Trowbridge has been investigating how technology alters the dynamics of inter-human relationships. His grand new paintings are at once abstract geometric paintings and functioning Quick Response (QR) codes. They are about 8 feet square. Their appearance, paint handling and palette reference canons of abstract geometric painting, such as Gerhard Richter’s Color Chart paintings (1966-), Piet Mondrian’s Broadway Boogie Woogie (1942-43), Hans Hoffman’s later abstract paintings and Josef Albers’ Homage to a Square (1965).</p>

<p>On the other hand, these colorful paintings, once scanned with the proper application, yield a text written by the artist. Usually one sees these QR codes, the next generation of barcodes, on product packaging and promotion materials. Scanning the black and white squares with a QR application on a smart phone can link the user to websites, text, and other kinds of data at a remote source. The hallmark of a QR code is an equal sized square within a square, repeated three times in the lower left, upper left and upper right corners of a larger square. With the frame established, a computer can read, in a zigzagged and zoned pattern, the binary code contained within it.</p>

<p>RESPONSIVE EYES</p>

<p>The Responsive Eye was an exhibition held at MoMA in New York in 1965. It brought together artworks by so-called ‘Op’ and minimalist artists such as Bridget Riley, Josef Albers, Viktor Vasarely and Almir Mavignier. The curator William Seitz described the show an ‘exhibition that would indicate an activity, not a kind of art’.</p>

<p>In the catalogue text Seitz writes, ‘The eye responds most directly when nonessentials such as freely modulated shape and tone, brush gestures and impasto are absent.’ He argued this was ‘non-objective perceptual art‘, art that ‘exists primarily for its impact on reception rather than for conceptual examination... Ideological focus has moved from the outside world, passed through the work as object, and entered the incompletely explored region area between the cornea and the brain.’</p>

<p>EDWARD BURRA</p>

<p>This is the first major exhibition for over twenty-five years of the work of Edward Burra (1905-1976), providing the opportunity to reassess one of the most individual and celebrated British artists of
the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Despite suffering from acute arthritis, Burra created a large body of memorable paintings during his lifetime, characterized
by their unusually powerful handling of the watercolour medium and his singular taste for the macabre. Defiantly anti-intellectual, he was nevertheless widely read and drew on an extraordinary range of artistic influences from old masters to his own contemporaries, as well as Hollywood cinema, ballet and jazz music.</p>

<p>In common with Lowry, Burra remained distinct from most mainstream modernist art movements though he was a member
of the English Surrealist Group in the 1930s and a close friend of the artist Paul Nash. Above all, Burra painted for himself,
describing his activity as ‘a sort of drug’ and each of his paintings creates a world unmistakably his own.</p>

<p>THE ART OF MONO-HA - REQUIEM FOR THE SUN</p>

<p>Mono-ha's primary tenet explores the encounter between natural and industrial objects, such as glass, stones, steel plates, wood, cotton, light bulbs, leather, oil, wire and Japanese paper, in and of themselves arranged directly on the floor or in an outdoor field. Evident in their works is a tendency based not on the art historical recuperation of objects, but on maintaining an affective relationship between works and our surrounding environment. That is, the works operate as a process of perceiving a perpetually passing present that opens the materiality of the work beyond what is simply seen. These practices are linked to the cultural milieu of process and post-minimalist art apparent on an international level during the 1960s and 1970s. What distinguishes their work is the refined technique of repetition as a studied production of difference developed over time in each artist's practice.</p>

<p>The exhibition will show select key installations, works on paper, and photographs that unveil resonant concepts and artistic methods relative to the exhibition. Some themes include perceiving works as actions or events, experiments in topology and spatial continuity, visceral materiality, and the contingency of the body. While the art of Mono-ha has been the subject of exhibitions in Asia and Europe, it is virtually unknown in North America. Requiem for the Sun: The Art of Mono-ha will provide the audience with a critical introduction to this extremely significant work.</p>

<p>YVONNE ROEB</p>

<p>The sculptor assimilates collective images from everyday life, cultural history, mysticism, religion and dream in a surreal way. She deals with first questions and last things and often makes references to the history of art. In her works one will always meet persecuted, transformed, morphological beings or bodies trying to merge together but who at the same time are stuck in an inner struggle or even exert subtle aggression.<br>Only the usability and the form allow conclusions regarding the history. The consensus of the essential has to be elaborated by the viewer. The panel looks like it has been made centuries ago, but obviously it was never finished or the images have vanished with years passing by. The plates become projection screens for the imagination of the viewer. But at the same time they emphasize their claim for autonomy.</p>

<p>JOHN CECIL STEPHENSON</p>

<p>Stephenson was one of the core modernists of the 1930's; indeed Herbert Read said that "he was one of the earliest artists in this country to develop a completely abstract style".
'Pioneer of Abstraction' will be a survey of John Cecil Stephenson's work between 1933 and 1939 covering his path from figurative painting to abstraction.</p>

<p>Born in Bishop Auckland in 1889 he won a scholarship to Leeds School of Art and later attended the Royal College of Art in London. On graduating he moved to Mall Studios, Hampstead where his neighbours and immediate circle included Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth, Piet Mondrian, Naum Gabo, Henry Moore and the art critic Herbert Read.<br>
The exhibition will be accompanied by a series of lectures exploring subjects including Constructivism, Modernism and British Art in the interwar period, by art historians, curators and academics.</p>

<p>SAM FALLS</p>

<p>"The work in this show is involved with my interest in representing time, its persistence and the signs of life present in the inanimate. Using photographic processes combined with sculptural and painterly material, I’m trying to give a feeling to constant variables - like light and weather - as well as our relative experiences of time.</p>

<p>The house pictures in this show were taken in Joshua Tree, California on film. They serve at once as documentation of reciprocal artworks of mine in the making, as well as unique pieces themselves. I put large colored sheets of fabric along the interior walls of these burnt out houses to create a different, but no less honest, image of the house. The fabric was left up to fade where it was exposed to the sun by missing windows and doors from the overall architecture, creating an imprint via light on the fabric, not so different from a photogram. The film documentation of these altered houses was scanned into the computer, and I used the color-picker in Photoshop to choose the color of the fabric and mimic its geometry over the image. I printed the pictures and took samples of the Photoshop-produced colors to Home Depot where they digitally matched the colors and mixed enamel house paints. Just as Photoshop samples only a part of the color, so does the paint matcher at Home Depot. I then physically painted over the sky of these roofless houses using a roller, so the representation of these places is manipulated but true. I put the color inside the home physically with the fabric, I put that representation on film with light, I put color on top of the picture digitally and then, finally, I physically painted the color on the image: mimicking reality and creating something, perhaps, more in tune. Beyond this, the photograph is not only an image, but also a new object. It is formed over time, rather than captured in an instant." Sam Falls</p>

<p>PABLO ALONSO - SOLUTIONS</p>

<p>Pablo Alonso is disclosing a new body of work that moves away from endgame narratives to new paradigms between painting and sculpture with the deconstruction as a starting point that questions the paintings authoritative status as well as the structure and the historical/cultural projection of the image.<br>
Some preliminary works realized in public spaces and based on uncontrolled pictorial experiments through anonymous and collective acts on the streets, reveal a satirically mistrusting point of view of an esthetic attitude for a sociological understanding of art giving shape to this exhibition. In the studio, folding, sanding, polishing, stapling, rolling, spraying, flaming, rubbing are some of the actions that have influenced the paintings increasing corporeal and architectural qualities and generating tensions between autonomous Modernist abstraction and traditional representation in order to subsume both categories in a simultaneous vision of art historical epochs and genres.</p>

<p>PIETRO ROCCASALVA - STRANGE YOUNG NEIGHBOURS</p>

<p>Roccasalva explores the potential for art objects to become active agents of simulacrum, sites where the animate and inanimate worlds undergo profound crossing. Painting serves as the orbital center for a practice that includes sculpture, performance, and video, and that has increasingly come to represent a self-contained universe of poetic narratives and philosophical inquiries.<br>Roccasalva has referred to his paintings as 'microchips', devices that organize an ever-expanding network of processes and allusions. Synthesizing compositional strategies drawn from religious iconography, modernist collage, and digital distortion, and skillfully rendered over months and even years, the figures in the paintings are both deeply familiar and impossibly strange. They freeze the gaze and conjure the sense that though artworks can never be fully understood, they are caught with their viewers in an endless feedback loop of exchanged signification.</p>

<p>The Strange Young Neighbours borrows its title from a standalone tale in Goethe's 1809 novel Elective Affinities. In the story, a near-catastrophic drowning plays a key role in uniting a young couple destined to be together since childhood.</p>

<p>ANNA BJERGER - SAND IN YOUR EYES</p>

<p>Anna Bjerger’s fascination is in the construction of an image. She works from photographs. Having found an image it might lie around her studio for some years while she absorbs its essence. The photographs she chose to work from for this show all have an inherent interference, either in the photographic process such as vaseline or coloured filters on the lens, or oil and turps stains from Bjerger’s studio. When painted, these disruptions cause the viewer to rethink the image and take a slower look.
 
The exhibition will feature a major new work, ‘Filter’, comprising an image of a woman holding a colour chart repainted 24 times on panels hung as a diamond grid. The repetition of a single motif, each treated with the same intensity, makes it impossible to relate to the panels as singular images. Their differences becomes virtues, their mistakes accepted, as it becomes more and more unclear what we are looking at.</p>

<p>HARALD KRÖNER - CUT</p>

<p>Kröner presents new large format coloured ink drawings from his series 'Cut' along with a group of much smaller works titled Schnittzeichnungen (sectional drawings).</p>

<p>Although different in size and appearance -  the theme of 'cutting' unites both bodies of work. Like the editing process in filmmaking, 'cut', is used to generate 'footage'-like material to be used later and determines what will eventually be seen or not.</p>

<p>Kröner's starting point are two painted sheets of paper: A large backdrop within which a semi-transparent sheet is cut into strips and reversed so both painted sides face one another.</p>

<p>The mirrored painted sides generate a form of osmosis which challenges the artist to discover a new balance between chance and control. Who can know if beauty will (re)appear between the poles of chaos and order. The process allows for little forethought and the results unpredictable - it's impossible for the artist to envisage what the semi-transparent sheet will produce once flipped. The pieces represent disruption, disorder and chaos that develop into more complex alignments. Kröner is interested in outwitting foresight and challenging the viewer's perception.</p>

<p>JOYCE PENSATO - BATMAN RETURNS</p>

<p>Joyce Pensato uses "Batman" as the predominant subject and inspiration for her paintings. "Batman" is a motif that first appeared in Pensato's drawings as early as the mid-1970's and has been used by the artist only periodically since, the last "Batman" painting, as singular work, having been executed in 1996. Pensato's resurrection of this iconic image sixteen years later marks an additional shift in her practice as it will be the first time that she has added various colors to what until now has been a strictly black, white and silver painting palette. Pastel color has played a role in Pensato's drawings over the years, but color in the paintings is new, and as with her drawings, the color element marks a layer within, simultaneously erased and darkened by the profuse and continual saturation of black and white enamel.</p>

<p>Alongside Pensato's batman motif will be paintings and drawings incorporating her familiar cartoon imagery of clowns, Homer Simpson, Groucho Marx, Mickey Mouse, and a character the artist refers to as "The Juicer." Furthermore, she will present assemblages of toys, ephemera, and stuffed animals throughout the gallery and will show as well approximately fifteen to twenty photographs of striking tableaux of the aforementioned elements taken by the artist at various times of day and night in her former studio. Through these old and new mediums,</p>

<p>FORMED THOUGHTS</p>

<p>Formed Thoughts explores the fundamental collaboration between maker and material in the forming of concepts and works. Curator Clare Twomey brings together work by artists Phoebe Cummings, Glithero (Tim Simpson &amp; Sarah van Gameren) and Tracey Rowledge to explore the active dialogue that materials provoke in the conception of new work and in its physical formation.</p>

<p>Works on display will include new work in Glithero's Burn Burn Burn series (previous work pictured), in which a flame travels over a path of flammable screen-printed paint, leaving behind it a charcoal trace which reveals the memory of a moment that has already passed. Phoebe Cummings' Vanitas explores the possibilities of clay as a raw material, disregarding notions of ceramics as a studio-based practice and as permanent possessions. Her installation will be constructed on site at Jerwood Space, where the work will be left to disintegrate and be broken down over the course of the exhibition. Tracey Rowledge will create new work for the exhibition, drawing directly onto the gallery wall over a 10-day period.<br>Her solid graphite wall drawing, Surface, creates a reflective plane that captures and subdues the light and the movement in the gallery space.</p>

<p>Under the title Monkey Business, the exhibition reveals a political, ironical stance that brings into question, once more, the position of the artist and the gallery within the universe of contemporary art. João Paulo Feliciano does not yield to the temptation of using a political discourse as expression of an activist or interventional action. On the contrary, he reveals his working processes using the gallery space as an extension of his daily activity as an artist and cultural producer. The exhibition is not built as a system of relations between different pieces but as a discourse that flows between the presentation of recent work and the appropriation of the space by displacing part of the imaginary contents of the artistís studio to the gallery. As if the exhibition was just one more moment in his daily life.</p>

<p>LUCIAN FREUD - PORTRAITS</p>

<p>Lucian Freud (1922 – 2011) was one of the most important and influential artists of his generation. Paintings of people were central to his work and this major exhibition, spanning over seventy years, is the first to focus on his portraiture.</p>

<p>Produced in close collaboration with the late Lucian Freud, the exhibition concentrates on particular periods and groups of sitters which illustrate Freud's stylistic development and technical virtuosity. Insightful paintings of the artist's lovers, friends and family, referred to by the artist as the 'people in my life', will demonstrate the psychological drama and unrelenting observational intensity of his work.</p>

<p>Featuring 130 works from museums and private collections throughout the world, some of which have never been seen before, this is an unmissable opportunity to experience the work of one of the world's greatest artists.</p>

<p>BORIS MIKHAILOV - TRIPTYCHS</p>

<p>Constituting a comprehensive overview of Mikhailov’s complex and varied oeuvre, the photographs selected for this exhibition come from ten different series, spanning a period of fifty years.
Since the mid 1960s, Boris Mikhailov has explored photography’s full range of possibilities and produced an uncompromising yet ironically humorous portrait of his close surroundings. His tireless investigations into photographic techniques and stylistic
means, as well as his frequent alternation between conceptual and documentary work have contributed to make Mikhailov one of the most influential photographers living today.</p>

<p>This exhibition will showcase works from the series Luriki (1971-85), Salt Lake (1996), I am not I (1992), If I were a German (1994), Case History (1997-98), Dedicated to Man Ray (1998), Look at me I look at Water (1999), Football (2000), Yesterday’s Sandwich (late 60s - late 70s), and The Wedding (2008).</p>

<p>BRYAN DRURY - PORTRAITS</p>

<p>Stemming from a desire to challenge the conventions of traditional portraiture, Drury has recently created
this body of six oil paintings. He carefully selected affluent members of society to sit for him, and rather than acquiescing to expectations of flattery, he exploits the power of oil paint to describe their corporeal flaws as precisely as possible. Finding liberation in this reversal of patronage roles, Drury focuses on the organic
quality of the flesh and shows the animalistic side of humans that we so commonly attempt to conceal.</p>

<p>The six works feature a single subject, executed with a painstaking degree of realism. The small-scale portraits capture the condescending and supercilious attitudes of the sitters, who gaze at the viewer with an
air of disdain. Set against solid backgrounds, the sitters seem separated from the outside world, and their
lifeless artificiality imbues the works with a sense of isolation.</p>

<p>DJ FOOD &amp; HENRY FLINT</p>

<p>Exhibits of artwork from DJ Food’s album ‘The Search Engine’ and Henry Flint’s book ‘Broadcast’.<br>
DJ Food, aka Strictly Kev, has read the British sci-fi comic 2000AD, home of Judge Dredd, since he was 8 years old. He’s also been collecting original art from it for over a decade and a large proportion of his collection is the work of one man, Henry Flint. Studying at Falmouth University, Henry has worked in comics since the early 90′s – mostly for the anthology title 2000AD but also for US publishers like Marvel, DC and Vertigo. He slowly refined his craft and became a fan favourite with his ultra-detailed storytelling, seemingly able to combine several different styles from the comic’s first golden age in the 80′s alongside his own distinctive pen work. He has drawn many of the comic’s main characters, including Judge Dredd, as well as created his own characters Shakara and Zombo with fellow script writers.</p>

<p>THERE IS A PLACE....</p>

<p>There is a Place...brings together a group of artists who explore our psychic connectivity to landscape.  The drawings, paintings and prints within the exhibition reveal 'a sense of place' as seemingly generic urban and suburban views evoke personal and collective memories.  The reverie of teenage hideouts, suburban housing estates and motorway junctions, each depicted in painstaking detail, are at once familiar yet unnerving for all.</p>

<p>The artists in this exhibition capture the most overlooked and peripheral spaces of our towns and cities, those unremarkable and unclaimed spaces that we each make our own.</p>

<p>FUTURA 2000 - EXPANSIONS</p>

<p>EXPANSIONS ... is the theme of the recent artwork at the Galerie Jérôme de Noirmont. Over the past three décades ; I have tried to define a style &amp; technique that would separate my work, from the other artists within my subculture. the process has allowed me to explore the realm of the ABSTRACT and spontaneous.</p>

<p>A new successor to Pollock’s "Action Painting" and Clyfford Still’s "colorfields" , FUTURA 2000 brings up to date what art critic Harold Rosenberg wrote in 1952: One after another, the American painters began to see the canvas as an arena in which to act, rather than a space in which to reproduce, redesign, analyze or express an object, real or imagined. What was produced on the canvas was not an image but an event.</p>

<p>Like Jackson Pollock, it is on the ground that FUTURA’s paintings most often take shape. In this way, he can understand the media as a whole and adapt it to his "paint brush": the spray can.
A way to control the energy and impulsive creativity he projects onto his paintings.</p>

<p>REAL/SURREAL</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn entirely from the deep holdings of the Whitney Museum’s permanent collection, will focus on the tension and overlap between two strong currents in twentieth century art. Although the term “realism” has many facets, a basic connection to the observable world underlies all of them; the subversion of reality through the imagination and the subconscious lies at the heart of Surrealism. Yet there are convergences in these different and even oppositional approaches to experience, and they encourage new ways of looking at the art of the twenties, thirties, and forties in America.<BR>
For example, Edward Hopper, famous for chronicling New York urban life, is also a painter whose own subjectivity and imagination are integral to his work. Many artists who developed imagery based on new and very specific, concrete conditions of industrial American, such as Charles Sheeler, were essentially interested in artificial worlds and presented these as distillations of reality. Even totally abstract painters such as Yves Tanguy depended on techniques developed from traditional, realist art to render bizarre worlds.</p>

<p>By willfully distorting such techniques, Helen Lundeberg and Mabel Dwight could quietly undercut our sense of stability even while showing us recognizable and even mundane objects and settings.</p>

<p>THOMAS HEATHERWICK - EXTRUDING AND SPINNING</p>

<p>Highlights of the exhibition will include four extruded, mirror polished, nickel plated, aluminium benches made without fixtures or fittings – the world’s first single component of metal furniture, extruded by machine. Heatherwick Studio commissioned a specially designed die through which a single billet of aluminium was ‘squeezed’ into a chair profile, complete with legs, seat and back. The aluminium emerges in a raw unpolished finish, which is then cut and sometimes shaped; each cut piece of bench then undergoes 300 hours of polishing.</p>

<p>The project, 18 years since conception, takes technology used in the aerospace industry to produce the world’s largest ever extruded piece of metal. The graceful aluminium pieces each have a unique, dramatic form that combines the back, seat and legs into one element. Until now, extrusion technology has been limited to smaller dimension profiles, and since graduating from the RCA in 1994, Heatherwick has been searching for a machine capable of producing a chair with legs, seat and back from a single component.</p>

<p>NICK MAUSS</p>

<p>For his second solo exhibition at 303 Gallery, Nick Mauss presents a landscape of images and notations, drawn across various forms. Accumulations of large aluminum sheets painted white and silkscreened with enlargements of Mauss' drawings or snapshots from his personal archive articulate the experience of looking at something that you have seen, thought about, made, and finding it strange or alien, and working with this strangeness as a material.</p>

<p>Like oversized leaves from a dented manuscript, the sheets heave, drape, and fold over one another, looped with tongues and cut-out windows that transfigure the images they support, ranging from the highly stylized rendering, to the prosaic: a mannequin hunched over a computer infiltrated by reflections of trees in the window; a rebus-like drawing of a crack, a chin resting on a hand, half of a sickle; a photograph of an archway modeled after an enlarged seashell; a drawing of a figure in a pose of supplication covered in a spattering of ink; a graphic frame enclosing white space; photographs of shadows of photographing hands and a camera held over sketches for dress designs; a floating dormant head suspended over a graphic ribbon hemmed in by a corner. Often the images stutter in repetition across multiple sheets, individually hand-colored or worked over, as if to correct, underscore, or elaborate.</p>

<p>ANSELM KIEFER - IL MISTERO DELLE CATTEDRALI</p>

<p>The title of the exhibition is taken from the esoteric publication by Fulcanelli (published in 1926), which claimed that the Gothic cathedrals of Europe had openly displayed the hidden code of alchemy for over 700 years.</p>

<p>As with all Kiefer's work, allusions are never literal but reflect an ongoing interest in systems - mystical and material - which have evolved over centuries. Both title and exhibition reflect Kiefer's longtime fascination with the transformative nature of alchemy: 'The ideology of alchemy is the hastening of time, as in the lead-silver-gold cycle which needed only time in order to transform lead into gold. In the past the alchemist sped up this process with magical means. That was called magic. As an artist I don't do anything differently. I only accelerate the transformation that is already present in things. That is magic, as I understand it.'</p>

<p>Object fictions assembles a diverse group of artists whose works investigate notions of perception, in its many definitions.

<p>CONOR HARRINGTON - DEAD MEAT</p>

<p>Entitled ‘Dead Meat’, Harrington's feast has the air of a last supper, ostentatious in its excesses and debauched in its crumbling beauty.</p>

<p>Making a departure from the battle scenes, posturing, and overt masculinity of his previous work this new body takes a step indoors with a behind-the-scenes look at men of power.  From an elaborate photo-shoot involving six models, costumes, taxidermy, and props Harrington has recreated an 18th-Century feast.  His interest in this period refers to an era when European power was at its peak and examines its heritage in contemporary society given the uncertainty within the Eurozone, as the Asian markets’ rise and established power structures shift.</p>

<p>Harrington raids art history, particularly the tradition of painting, as he samples classics and reworks with free association.  The largest canvas from his show depicts a female nude reclining on a table, observing both herself and the view through a mirror - a direct nod to ‘The Rokeby Venus’ by Velsasquez.<br>Referencing Manet’s ‘Déjuner sur L’Herbe’, the artist has clothed his male subjects in traditional 18th-Century garb in contrast to their female counterparts who appear in the nude. While prostitutes from the street have been traditionally employed as models, Harrington has opted for a 21st-Century approach, sourcing his girls through topless model websites in search of exemplary post-feminist beauties with no qualms about profiting from their physiques in what has become an increasingly body-conscious and pornography-soaked culture. Subtly reworking historical narratives and replacing ethnicities, ‘Mary’ is displayed as a young topless black woman, and the offerings from the ‘Three Wise Men’ lifeless birds and the gift of flesh: death is at the centre of glory and finery.</p>

<p>GARY HUME -THE INDIFFERENT OWL</p>

<p>Over the past twenty years, Hume has developed a distinctive visual language of bold, simplified forms to create paintings that engage the viewer with their pleasantly irresolvable quality. The exhibition, his first in London for over four years, brings together a large and varied body of new work that will occupy both the Hoxton Square and Mason's Yard galleries.</p>

<p>A painting by Gary Hume is a dynamically ambiguous visual experience. Although each work usually features a recognisable motif - such as a bird or flower - they are often flattened and fractured, and positioned awkwardly in a pictorial space that is brought to life through broad passages of colour that could be repellently acrid or seductively luscious. Negative and positive spaces fluctuate within a painting, stretching figuration to the point that lines, forms and colours start to lose their denotative function. 'Neither literal nor illusionistic,' writes Jennifer Higgie in her catalogue essay, Hume's paintings 'draw you into the depths of something you might have initially assumed was all surface.'</p>

<p>DREAM  IN COLOUR - AN EXHIBITION BY STYLOROUGE</p>

<p>Legendary designers for Blur, Trainspotting &amp; The Cure produce their first series of contemporary artworks to coincide with their 30th anniversary.</p>

<p>This London-based creative consultancy was founded in 1981 by creative director, Rob O’Connor, who has steered Stylorouge through various phases embracing design for print, web and multimedia, photography and video production.  The team have created some of the most well regarded imagery for the music and movie industries for over 30 years for the likes of Blur, Morrissey, Rolling Stones, George Michael and the now iconic artwork for Trainspotting amongst many others. <br>To celebrate their 30th anniversary Stylorouge have let their creative minds loose on a whole new series of art pieces for a groundbreaking exhibition of personal artistic work with their whole team entering a process of self-directed artistic creation specifically for the show. The resulting video installations, assemblages, painting and photography give a unique insight into the concerns and motivations of one of the most progressive and engaging creative studios once freed from commercial constraints.</p>

<p>JOHN RIEPENHOFF PRESENTS HANDLER</p>

<p>John Riepenhoff presents Handler, a series of collaborative figurative sculptures, papier-mâché legs outfitted in Riepenhoff’s pants and shoes holding large-scale paintings by Peter Barrickman, Nicholas Frank, Richard Galling, Michelle Grabner, Greg Klassen, Jose Lerma, Scott Reeder and Tyson Reeder.</p>

<p>A painting walks into a gallery and hangs out on the wall. The gallerist says "move up a little". The painting moves up a little. The gallerist says "looks great". The painting doesn't say anything, it's legs walk away to do something else.</p>

<p>In Art Stand Series, pairs of papier-mâché legs outfitted in Riepenhoff’s pants and shoes hold large-scale paintings by other artists. These unconventional easels simulate the perspective of the art-handler, making visible one of the unseen laborers integral to exhibition making. By ascribing equal value to handler and artist, the artwork suddenly renders the social boundaries within the art community permeable.</p>

<p>GERT &amp; UWE TOBIAS</p>

<p>Gert &amp; Uwe Tobias’ exhibitions often incorporate wall paintings, large-scale woodcut prints, collages, type-writer drawings and ceramic sculptures.

<p>ROBERT SAGERMAN - IT'S TIME</p>

<p>For all their sensuality and tactility, Sagerman’s paintings are not merely a thicket of color to capture the eye. As he works, the artist maintains a log of the number of strokes in each painting, the minutes spent with each color, and the total time a piece takes to complete. This uniquely personal form of meditation stemmed from Sagerman’s study of medieval Jewish mysticism, where the act of assigning numerical values to the letters of holy writings and the ritualized combining and recombining of these numbers brought the meditator closer to a state of divine clarity. This counting action most clearly defines Sagerman’s objective for his work: “For me,” he explains, “the numbers themselves are the most direct expression of my work activity; it is they that suggest the immaterial essence of the work.”</p>

<p>The new body of work for It’s Time accentuates the tension between the sensual and the immaterial elements of the work. The lush colors that once merged with one another to create an overall glow of tone now at times shift from one edge of the canvas to the other, gradating dramatically and creating subtle landscape references. In some, marks are no longer made in a uniform direction, but radiate from a central point. The visual, visceral essence of the work is heightened by the increasingly complex spiritual substrate buoying it.</p>

<p>PAINTING CANADA - TOM THOMSON</p>

<p>In the early twentieth century in Toronto, Canada, the first stirrings of a new movement of painting were being felt. A group of artists started to engage with the awesome Canadian wilderness, a landscape previously considered too wild and untamed to inspire ‘true’ art. Tom Thomson paved the way for this artistic collective, the Group of Seven, and their works have become revered in Canada. This exhibition will reintroduce their stunning impressions of the Canadian landscape to the British public for the first time since the 1920s</p>

<p>STEPHAN DOITSCHINODD - NOVO ASCETICISMO</p>

<p>Doitschinoff creates a unique visual language and style by embracing his eclectic influences. Themes in his work are inspired by an informed spiritual history and heritage, rich in symbolism and often accompanied by Latin text. In Novo Asceticismo (New Asceticsm), he reflects on the sacrifice and deprivation necessary for modern man to live purely, without feeling alienated or falling into vices, mental traps and social conditioning of contemporary society. He explores concepts constituting new forms of practicing austerity in regards to self-discipline in manners of sexuality and the body as well as contemporary Shamanism. The work is permeated by themes of Asceticsm, redefined to reflect political issues of our times.</p>

<p>To research for this exhibition, Doitschinoff traveled to Portugal, studying cultural festivals of the northern region and the traditions of caretos who wear Ibera masks. These ceremonies and masks were the artist’s main inspiration in Lisbon where he created an installation in the form of a temple to serve as the site for his performance piece, Briho do Sol (Sunshine), documented in a short film which will be shown for the first time during Novo Ascenticismo.</p>

<p>GORDON MOORE</p>

<p>The current group of large scale paintings further develops the abstracted format and reduced palette of the works exhibited in Moore’s previous shows. Notably, these new paintings reflect the artist’s interest in photography, positing dimensional space next to drawn space. Moore combines three or more distinct spaces within a single canvas with drawn lines that vary from deliberate to random. Moore describes himself as an empiricist and the paintings reveal an abstract but very tangible world.</p>

<p>The works on paper in this exhibition are, as the title implies, ink and acrylic on photo-emulsion paper.  Here the tangible meets the abstract as the incidental photograph of a broken umbrella or a bent coat hanger converse with the drawn lines and the painted areas.</p>

<p>OMID DELAFROUZ</p>

<p>Omid Delafrouz builds his images through a meticulous process. They are charged with references tied to our age and more particularly to the young generation that grew up during the last twenty years of 20th century, in a popular culture obsessed with images, surface and consumption. His detailed images are filled with time-markers, where every individual element relates to other parts of the work and jointly create layers of meanings and narratives.</p>

<p>A fundamental idea for Omid’s work is an attempt to express the zeitgeist with its own means. He depicts people and places in his own surroundings with the same means and tools as the types of images his generation grew up with.</p>

<p>JONATHAN YEO - YOU'RE ONLY YOUNG TWICE</p>

<p>For his first UK show since 2008, Yeo makes a departure from his renowned portraits and collages to explore the fast-growing phenomenon of cosmetic surgery. Over the last 18 months, Yeo has been observing the work of leading cosmetic surgeons in the UK and US to produce a collection of work that uncovers the processes and results of pre and post-operative procedures on women.</p>

<p>Surprisingly gentle in his depiction, the artist shuns controversy in favour of the physical transformations and the black ink lines the surgeons draw directly onto the body prior to such operations. The result is a series of scientific images seen through a painter's eye which pose questions about our aspirations, vanities, the lengths we will go to in the pursuit of perfection, and the role of surgeons as 21st century sculptors of the physical form.</p>

<p>PEDRO CABRITA REIS</p>

<p>In his work, Pedro Cabrita Reis uses building materials (brick, fluorescent tube, electric cable, double glazing…) as well as “found” items (doors, windows, benches, ladders…), that he brings together and assembles into sculptures. The essence of Pedro Cabrita Reis’s work is to be found in the very act of construction. Although he always initiates a dialogue with the spaces he inhabits, his goal is not to suggest new architectural forms. His sculptures act as vectors for emotions: they create imaginary territories, evoking familiar architectural landscapes, of which only traces seem to remain. Faced with his work, the spectator experiences feelings of absence and silence, characteristics which run through the whole of the artist’s oeuvre.</p>

<p>While Pedro Cabrita Reis is perhaps best known for his sculpture, the artist has defined himself through painting: “I see myself as a painter, in the classic sense of the word….It is as a painter that I relate to the world.…All that I have ever done are paintings; some of them lighter, hung on walls, then heavier ones, set on the ground, and even some that encompass whole spaces.</p>

<p>BILLY CHILDISH - I AM THE BILLY CHILDISH</p>

<p>A modern day renaissance man, prolific artist, writer, and musician Billy Childish truly embraces and encompasses the expression “walking to the beat of his own drum.” Over thirty-five years of continual creative activity, Childish has gained a cult status world-wide, writing and publishing over forty volumes of confessional poetry, recording over one hundred LPs, and painting several hundred works, all the while refusing to conform to the contemporary art world’s standards and placed importance on the market.<br>As a poet, novelist, and painter, Childish has explored throughout his work, and often with a startling honesty, his struggles in coming to terms with addiction, abuse, and a childhood spent in a dysfunctional family setting.</p>

<p>Presented in two sections, curator Matthew Higgs highlights Childish’s recent body of work and places it alongside his music, literary and polemical projects. The first section of the exhibition focuses on the artist’s recent paintings that depict volcanoes and mountain-climbing scenes, influenced by the last climb of mountaineer Toni Kurz. These works will are juxtaposed with paintings of pastoral landscapes such as “Sibelius Amongst Saplings.” The exhibition continues upstairs with a survey of the artist’s music and literary projects, including fifty of Childish’s albums and a collection of poems and books written by the artist.</p>

<p>JOAN MITCHELL - THE LAST PAINTINGS</p>

<p>This show brings together 13 works, dating from 1985–1992, that represent Mitchell’s exploration of painting in the last decade of her life. The exhibition is accompanied by a full-color catalogue with a text by Richard D. Marshall.</p>

<p>Joan Mitchell (1925–1992) moved from Chicago to New York in 1947. Early in her career, she was included in the historically significant 1951 Ninth Street Exhibition. Organized by Leo Castelli, the show was renowned for its championship of Abstract Expressionism, and positioned Mitchell with older, mostly male painters: Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline among them. Mitchell met de Kooning early on—inspired by his painting, she sought out an introduction and was a rare female participant in artistic debates at the notorious Cedar Tavern. In 1952, she had her first solo exhibition at the New Gallery.</p>

<p>SAYRE GOMEZ - WINDOWS AND MIRRORS</p>

<p>Debut exhibition in his Chicago gallery of new work from the Los Angeles based artist Sayre Gomez. On view are the artist's new works on canvas, thirty small works on paper, and a single graphite drawing. By mining images and texts from various blogs and image archives, Gomez' new works are an extension of the artist's inquiry into how aesthetics inform perception and how meaning is disseminated and contextualized.</p>

<p>Selecting images on a solely formal criterion, Gomez states that he seeks "Images that imbue a sense of familiarity yet remain difficult to place, this begins to create a dialogue about an images' legibility and thus the frameworks through which we use to digest them. Through the incessant re-constitution and re-experiencing of any number of said images, a lapse in their contextual foregrounding becomes apparent. They begin to resonate with viewers in variety of ways, and can begin to function more as abstractions... While the previous generation's engagement with image culture was primarily through television and print media, the images being absorbed were contextually bound to their original sources implicating the process of appropriation as something definitively politicized. While these implications may still be present the appropriative process here is intended to be less political and more populous.."</p>

<p>The Berlin artist shows five large-format and two small-sized works from 2010 and 2011. All paintings are made of encaustic and tempera on wood. Martin Assig’s pictures "are physically present and transpersonal. Something in these pictures seem  extremely familiar, yet it has  never been seen before. These pictures need no regional or time-bound artistic style-classification; they catch your eye and
stay in mind". Assig’s pictures consist of elements full of tradition and history, but in these pictures they appear in a state of innocence, like objects that are seen totally new, that are unknown. The viewer can revive the pictorial bodies of Martin Assig. So that they can be new, time and again.</p>

<p>BYRON KIM</p>

<p>In this new series of work, Kim paints night in the city, evoking the quality of light and hazy cloud formations in the transition from dusk to dark and beyond. He depicts the state of constant suspension that city dwellers experience; the omnipresent lights block their view into the cosmos and deny a resolution to the day that true darkness delivers. The paintings in this ongoing series, measuring 90 x 72 inches, often have hard-edged, painted borders on two or three sides that act as reminders of the architectural elements like windows, cornices and facades of buildings that frame our views of the city sky. Kim paints his crepuscular skies from memory, creating open spaces that act as trigger points for the viewer’s inner dialogue, giving the imagination room to resonate and remember.</p>

<p>DAMIEN FLOOD - HISTORY OF THE VISITATION</p>

<p>Flood’s practice has evolved in rich and fascinating ways.  He continues to push and exploit the potential of his primary medium, oil on canvas, with intriguing results.  His world is expanding in alien directions, apparently devoid of natural light or sometimes about that light.  Equally it is unashamedly and indulgently caught between, on the one hand, an abandon born of an abstract use of his medium and, on the other, maintaining one limb in the “ real “ world.  The boundary between “real” and fictional, however, is no longer meaningful in Flood’s vocabulary.</p>

<p>Never one to stay in one place for too long, he has for The History of the Visitation, produced a corpus of paintings and objects that is as diverse, unpredictable and open as ever.  No one overriding theme emerges.<br>Flood’s world or New Geography is, at times, microscopic in its focus but in spite of or even because of this can very quickly lead us to an imaginary vast expanse.</p>

<p>All is never as it seems or straightforward or even stationary in Flood’s work.  In Dot Dot Dot and Rock and Cylinder, for example, one painting supplants another in a reversal of strategy or is it a doubling up of narratives.  No one reading is possible or, if you go by previous belief systems and bodies of knowledge, like the one quoted by the artist : the world according to the now discredited 17th Century theoretician and cleric Athanasius Kirchner, desirable.</p>

<p>JR - ENCRAGES</p>

<p>The first major solo show by JR, after displaying his work in the biggest Museum of the world, the walls of the cities, JR faces the walls of the Gallery.
JR creates monumental photographs that he pastes around the world, infiltrating in urban life anonymous portraits, witnesses of the present and the past : Women are Heroes, in Rio de Janeiro, Jaipur, Nairobi, (2008-2010), which gave its title to JR’s movie that was selected at the Festival de Cannes in 2010 ; The Wrinkles of the City in Carthagena, Shanghai, Los Angeles (2008-2011).
JR reveals art by action, displaying his gigantic prints over the suburban buildings of Paris, on walls in the Middle East or in the United States, on broken bridges in Africa or in favelas in Brazil.</p>

<p>Never-seen before artwork and films will be shown, as well as a pasting on the facade of the Gallery.
Committed art, street art, participative art, ephemeral art… Beyond any category, JR makes us think by inviting on stage anonymous heroes, displaying the faces of humanity, multiple and one at the same time.</p>

<p>MIRIAM CAHN</p>

<p>This exhibition will focus on Cahn's painting practice spanning three decades. A beloved and historically significant voice in Switzerland, Cahn represented her home country at the 41st Venice Biennale in 1984.</p>

<p>In Drawing Room Confessions Issue #3, a journal published on the occasion of Cahn's current solo exhibition with the David Roberts Art Foundation in London, Cahn describes how her investigations in film, drawing, books, and performance inevitably led to making paintings. Growing up with black and white television and experiencing art history through books with black and white plates brought Cahn to rule out color as an unnecessary complication in her early career. Color signified wealth since few could afford to print in color.</p>

<p>Years later, Cahn began producing paintings in color for the first time. Cahn's psychosomatic color palette is generational, influenced by the hyperreality of color experience depicted in artificially colored films like Michelangelo Antonioni's, Il deserto rosso (1964). The idiosyncratic quality of her paintings can be seen as an intentional confusion of perception with reality. The figure, animal, or landscape becomes reduced to a few brutal performative gestures in some paintings while areas of sensitive but deliberate rendering exist in others.</p>

<p>WALKING: TO DRAW THE WORLD</p>

<p>Walking: To Draw the World consists of Keijiro Suga’s poetry, Ai Sasaki’s drawings and a display of books based on the theme of ‘books for walking, reading and thinking’. Inspired by the words of Suga, a poet, Sasaki’s drawings are created conjunctively, as though to huddle together with Suga’s poetry.<br>
They are made through a varied selection of materials including colored pencil, pastel and colored inks, and each has varied expressions. Slowly walking through the gallery, the experience of being transfixed between the imaginative scenes that the poetry invites as well as the time spent speculating about the drawings will no doubt conjure a new facet to the act of walking within the viewer.</p>

<p>The “Walking” project began in 2009 at Gallery Zero in Ikuta Library, Meiji University and was further developed by Keijiro Suga (b.1958) and Ai Sasaki (b.1976, Osaka). The project was exhibited at the Glass Pyramid of Moerenuma Park (Hokkaido), and continues today.</p>

<p>SIXEART</p>

<p>Sixeart shows his new exhibition Cosmovisión Andina y los Hijos del Inti at the N2 Gallery, where some contemporary art lovers discovered him a year before he was selected to exhibit his work in the Tate Modern. Some might think that Sixeart has been lucky. He has, indeed. But in my opinion his success is due to the unselfish work he has done for many years, and above all, it is due to his outstanding and unprejudiced style.</p>

<p>Cosmovisión Andina y los Hijos del Inti" is an approach to ancient Andean cultures, full of colour, wisdom and mysticism. Sixeart use his pictorial language in order to reinvent a new idea of ancestral reconnection.</p>

<p>YANG JIECHANG - TALE OF THE 11TH DAY</p>

<p>By calling the exhibition - Tale of the 11th Day, Yang Jiechang deliberately extends the 10th day of Boccaccio’s Decameron with his paradise landscape. Here, people and animals frolic quite freely, reminding us that on the one hand humans may well be animals that have evolved, but that today they have become unnatural. Myths and legends, ancient narratives, the history of art, religion and customs and popular beliefs all relate stories of animals that have been a part of human history, accompanying our development.</p>

<p>The presentation of the two-part exhibition shows Yang Jiechang’s ability to alternately summon forth self-sublimation or active participation through works that are both traditional and yet completely of their time from the point of view of composition and the ideas they convey. By imagining a 10th Day for Boccaccio’s Decameron, Yang Jiechang has fundamentally gone back to the great Confucian scholars who thought their own ideals more important than any political system. He immerses us in a Paradise where all nature’s creations seem to live together in peace</p>

<p>SIGMAR POLKE</p>

<p>In the first international exhibition of the German artist Sigmar Polke after his death in June, 2010, at the age of 69, MASP presents the complete series of graphic works (edition prints) created by this visual artist between 1963 and 2009. On the whole, more than 220 pieces lent by the collectionist Axel Ciesielski plus the series Day by Day with 25 works in mixed media  created by Polke for the International Art Biennial of São Paulo in 1975, which were lent to this exhibition by another private German collection.</p>

<p>Considered one of the most significant artists of post-war Europe, Polke was born in 1941 in Silesia – a region incorporated by Eastern Germany in 1949 and  shared today by  Poland, Czech Republic and Germany. When he was 12 years old he moved, along with his family, to the then Western Germany and at 20 he enrolls at the Art Academy of Düsseldorf. In 1963, he becomes known  when organizing, with his class-mates Gerhard Richter and Konrad Fischer (then Konrad Lueg), the performance (and later the movement) called Capitalist Realism, so named in order to make a satire of the Socialist Realism, the official aesthetic and artistic doctrine of the Soviet Union, and also to criticize the market driven art world in Western capitalism.</p>

<p>FREDDY CHANDRA - SYNTHETIC RESONANCE</p>

<p>Constructed of luminously painted bars of cast acrylic, Freddy Chandra’s work invites the viewer into a seamlessly crafted sensational experience.  Working within the confines of a logical structure, color is drawn across the surface of the bars in such a way as to create an illusion of depth and an inner light that lend the pieces a lyrical flow. Though static, the pieces imply movement as the colors vibrate off one another, and the bars engage with the negative space of the wall that drifts between them. External space punctuates and disrupts the internal space of the work, and a rhythm is formed as presence relates to absence. This combination of structured form and fluid gesture raises the question: is one viewing an image, or an object?</p>

<p>Chandra, whose background in architecture strongly informs his work, views his process as one that is brought to fruition through a unique method of drawing-based mark making, rather than painting.</p>

<p>ERIK FRYDENBORG - DR. (ILLEGIBLE)</p>

<p>Erik Frydenborg develops a sustained examination of a single, found scholastic illustration. Through a series of dissections, alterations, and physical reconstructions of the original image, Frydenborg merges elements of collage, sculpture, display architecture, and a “timeline” of taxonomic wall reliefs, constructing a chimerical museum environment. In an elliptical blending of analysis and fiction, the objects on view are presented as historical artifacts from the obsolescent work of a vaguely described, possibly delusional academic-- likely discredited in his methods, and separated by an irretrievable distance from our own era.</p>

<p>In its staging of these ersatz specimens, Dr. (illegible) traces a quixotic combination of morphologic diagnosis with the lyrical composition of abstract parts. The exhibition’s central illustration—a once discernable machine surgically reduced to an illogical hull and its extracted organs— is recreated as a wooden model and a set of colored plastic morphemes. These molded symbols are incorporated into an ordered sequence of linear display, where their repetition and chromatic coding suggest the transcription of a musical score, an archaeological catalog, or a hieroglyphic system of unknown purpose.</p>

<p>RYAN MCLENNAN - ABOMINATIONS</p>

<p>McLennan’s acrylic and graphite on paper works depict the animal kingdom exclusively. But don’t be surprised if the subjects’ “bad behavior” has an uncanny familiarity. Though the birds, snakes, rodents, and elk carry the authenticity of a dedicated naturalist and master draftsman, their actions are pure allegory for human motives and behavior, some of it of the worse sort. Without resorting to anthropomorphizing these four-legged, winged, or slithering creatures, McLennan transposes human motives onto carefully researched animal behavior, and in the process he reveals just how common those links may be.</p>

<p>Abominations takes up universal questions, such as speculating on the existence of God and what it means to be moral. In the large work The Immortal, an elk with an impressive rack is pinned by a tree branch into a peculiar, torture-like pose against a white background. On and about him are smaller creatures, hummingbirds and rats, that appear to relish in the great beast’s suffering. Or perhaps they’re merely rubbernecking, taking in the tragic fall of the mighty with relief but also a little schadenfreude.</p>

<p>MARA DE LUCA - SALTUS FIDEI | LEAP OF FAITH</p>

<p>Titled the Sipario series (Italian for theatrical curtain or scrim), Mara De Luca’s exciting new paintings are a reflection on a contemporary sublime that is profound in its absolute superficiality and theatricality.  The Sipario paintings are inspired by the aesthetic and emotional experience of daily life in Los Angeles, a city of visual contrasts and contradictions: stunning natural beauty coexisting in a cultural climate of facile content, saturated digital aesthetics and air-brushed, synthetic effects.  The works address the existential through a romanticized and hyper-analog translation of digital media and contemporary imaging tropes particular to mass media and visual culture.</p>

<p>In the Sipario paintings, constructed landscape and atmospheric imagery present a mirroring of process and content - their exaggerated artifice reveals and disguises the processes by which they have been made, and a relationship between picture and craft is evident.  Ranging in color from bright, glowing artificial to a natural and grayscale palette, the picture planes are vast and vacuous, evoking the emotional emptiness of unflinchingly optimistic, success-oriented Hollywood values and self-improvement ideology.  Iconographic elements - appearing as recurring texts, rainbows, moon and stars - point to themes of faith, hope and desire.  Visual “faith”, or suspension of disbelief, is required of the viewer throughout and is a thematic thread connecting the diverse works.</p>

<p>ANDREW SALGADO - ANXIOUS</p>

<p>This is Andrew Salgado's first solo exhibition in New York City, sees the artist drawing upon historic masculine portraiture handled with an experimental, painterly sensibility, suggesting themes of displaced identity and an overriding technical love for the medium. Salgado’s paintings are an exploration of the concept of masculine identity through an assertive, gestural approach to figurative representation.</p>

<p>The works reference Classical archetypes found in figurative masculine portraiture, while prioritizing a disregard for what Salgado views as the 'parameters' of figurative painting; Salgado himself recounts artists as diverse as Caravaggio, Veronese, Bjarne Melgaard, Francis Bacon, and Daniel Richter as influences. As a result, the works resonate with a frenetic, nearly schizophrenic energy, suggesting both a serene recollection of memory and convalescence (a number of the works feature mouthless boys, perhaps suggesting Salgado's victimization in a 2008 hate-crime assault in which he lost his teeth,) but move beyond mere solipsism in favor of metaphor, narrative and aggressive, abstract brushwork.</p>

<p>JOSH KEYES - MIGRATION</p>

<p>On the subject of his show title, in the artist’s words, “Migration and displacement were ideas that continued to surface in my mind while I was painting these images. I was thinking about the effects of climate change and the way some ecosystems that thrive in a specific range of temperatures—like polar or tropical climates—are experiencing a shrinking of their boundaries. Ecosystems that were separate are now slowly merging and overlapping one another, causing disruptions in the food web and increased competition for food and space among species. Some become displaced and are forced to migrate, in order to survive.”</p>

<p>Keyes’ imagery in this exhibition pushes the potential consequences of ecosystem clashing to a climax that wavers on the surreal. A bright orange tiger rests contently on top of a graffiti covered dumpster, staring intensely at a pack of wolves, scavenging whitetail deer scraps from the tiger’s morning hunt. Below the smooth floodwater surface, glides a great white shark. A pair of giant pandas, marooned on a submerged jeep, watch with curiosity as the shark’s fin circles by. Deer, elk, wolves and other animals form a stampeding herd, charging through a city street, leaving upturned cars and ruptured pavement in their frenzied wake.</p>

<p>KATHARINE KUHARIC - POUND OF FLESH</p>

<p>Taking stock pictures ("unsolicited images" from junk mail, newspapers, magazines and other sources) Kuharic meticulously re-collages images to create reconfigured histories. Her paintings are multi-layered, hyper-real, and highly keyed to an almost hallucinogenic pallet making them overwrought, sensual, and alluring. Seventeen distinct works highlight investigations into American celebrity, pop and suburban culture as well as her personal angst.</p>

<p>In both Jack's Original and Ladue News, Kuharic takes residents of St. Louis and Ladue respectively and has them reposed on absurdist constructions. In Jacks Original, the grouped figures are given extra girth and she gives them a gesture of shame by having each person cover their genitals and waistlines. The people represented in Ladue News are from a society magazine with the same name. The posed pleasantness amidst the collapsing structure creates a despotic tension.</p>

<p>Pound of Flesh is an ongoing series where Kuharic tracks her weight loss and gain through repeated symbols and motifs. The years accumulate in yellow eggs laid across the bottom of the painting and her corresponding weight is recorded in red balloons above. In the center of the painting is a tangle of holly hocks, the symbol of female ambition. In addition to the measure of weight, these paintings also show the lost possibility of fertility and represent all that is fecund. Flora and fauna are depicted throughout as well as graphics of the Weight Watchers frozen dinners. This contrast of nourishment and hollow, empty food is the key metaphor for the painting.</p>

<p>Exhibition runs through to November 12th, 2011</p>

<p>LEA ASJA PAGENKEMPER - THE LOVER AND THE MAGICAN</p>

<p>The exhibition “The Lover and the Magician” presents the latest works by Baselitz master student L. A. Pagenkemper. Her paintings focus on symbolically charged landscapes which, beyond any realistic illusionism, are committed to moments that lyrically render the atmosphere.<br>
 The artist places iconic elements from daily life in utopian landscapes. This is done to symbolically present human situations of love and Eros, magic and disillusion, excess and decay. In addition to these references to the painting of a Munch or Gauguin, Pagenkemper’s simplified and original manner of representation discloses a quest for expression and feeling that resists the deceptive illusionism of (media) reality, to ultimately put forth a different option, that of a changed subjectivity.</p>

<p>GEORGE CONDO - MENTAL STATES</p>

<p>This is the first major retrospective of the American artist George Condo. Since his emergence in New York's East Village in the early 1980s, George Condo has developed a provocative body of work that, for all its outlandish humour and outrageousness, is deeply engaged with the memory of European and American traditions of painting. Focusing on his 'imaginary portraits', which conjure varied mental states with a mixture of comic absurdity and the heart-rending pathos, and incorporating sculpture as well painting, the exhibition offers a comprehensive survey of
three decades of his art.</p>

<p>WES LANG - LIFE AND HOW TO LIVE IT</p>

<p>The exhibition offers, as the title indicates, a personal reflection on how to navigate life. It is not a self-help or how to guide. It is an interlinked series of meditations on being. Being Wes Lang and being all of us. The subject matter is personal universal, complex and mundane; friends and mentors, dead, alive or both. Good times, bad times and the value of each. The hazards of living, enjoying life, cigarettes and drink, in the light of our impending death. Love for one, for many and briefly for all. The rage and acceptance of not going gentle into that good night.</p>

<p>The works reference a diverse and eclectic selection of artists and thinkers such as Walt Whitman, Ram Dass, Bob Dylan, Cy Twombly, The Grateful Dead, Glenn Gould, Chet Baker, Martin Kippenberger and Jean Michel Basquiat amongst others. In Wes Lang’s work, these references bleed into a song about appreciating life. Be here now. A path through uncertain times, a personal letter expressing confidence in self doubt, beauty, ugliness and human abilities. The letter ends with the words ”Eyes Of The World - Best Wishes” in the painting titled “Freedom Machine” featuring a large portrait of the grim reaper.</p>

<p>TIM BISKUP - FORMER STATE</p>

<p>Tim Biskup's new collection of paintings looks strangely familiar. Maybe
it's the unavoidable Biskup-ness of his color palate or the uncomfortable, slightly "off" expressions of his characters. Whatever it is, it is intentional. This exhibition was carefully planned out from the very beginning of it's conception. Something that skews dramatically from Biskup's improvisational past. It's not like he hasn't put a lot of thought into his shows (His last NYC show was accompanied by a 60 page book of text.).</p>

<p>The difference here is the level of focus. The show is almost entirely made up of large scale paintings in the artist's polygonal style.<br>
To add another layer of unity, the subjects are a series of small mask-like heads. These are not the carefully produced characters that make up his vast array of vinyl figures, but small, roughy hewn, crudely painted things that the artist sculpted himself.</p>

<p>Exhibition runs from October 14th to November 4th, 2011</p>

<p>LOUIS VUITTON  - THE ART OF HOTEL LABELS - SET TWO</p>

<p>Louis Vuitton publishes a second box set of 30 hotel labels from its private collection. Presented in an elegant boxed set, each postcard adhesive for the first time, equally evokes the art of travel and the
great hotels of the world, from the Plazza Athénée in Paris to the Astor
House in Shanghai. Louis Vuitton thus pays tribute to this lost tradition which consisted in sticking hotel labels on the trunks and luggage of passing travellers.</p>

<p>This collection of hotel labels witnesses stories and anecdotes that were carefully collected over the years by its passionate owner, Gaston-Louis Vuitton. Gaston-Louis Vuitton (1883-1970), grandson of Louis, booklover, traveller and collector has, throughout his life, put together a unique collection of 3,000 hotel labels which are today kept in the House archives. Stuck onto trunks and luggage, these labels admittedly had an advertising objective but also created the desire to travel the world, as well as providing information on the journeys and detours made by the owner of said trunk.</p>

<p>RICHARD WENTWORTH</p>

<p>Since the 1970s, Richard Wentworth has established himself as one of the major figures of New British Sculpture alongside Tony Cragg, Anish Kapoor and Richard Deacon. His work has also been of crucial importance in the development of the following generation and among others The Young British Artists.<br>
The work of Richard Wentworth is characterised by its unusual visual poetry. The artist’s raw materials are to be found in everyday objects, which he photographs or assembles within his sculptures and installations. Through the use of juxtaposition, isolation and compilation, he exposes the formal and sculptural qualities of objects from our surroundings and explores their meaning and function. His oeuvres investigate notions of balance, weight and how space is occupied, while challenging the traditional definition of sculpture.</p>

<p>LISA YUSKAVAGE</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, Yuskavage has developed her own genre of the female nude: lavish, erotic, cartoonish, vulgar, angelic young women cast within fantastical landscapes or dramatically lit interiors. They appear to occupy their own realm while narcissistically contemplating themselves and their bodies. Rich, atmospheric skies frequently augment the psychologically-charged mood, further adding to the impression of theatricality and creative possibility.</p>

<p>For this exhibition, Yuskavage takes her complex narratives to a larger scale, whose sheer vastness adds a cinematic component to the works. More so than previously, this new body of work appears to merge the genres of landscape, still life, and portrait painting. Despite their immediacy, the plots reveal themselves slowly over time. Her compositions are equally prolonged: the terrains are more spacious and more intricately articulated than in previous works, which heightens a sense of realism while at the same time dismantling easy construction of meaning.</p>

<p>ADELA LEIBOWITZ - THE UNTITLED</p>

<p>Defying easy categorization, the works - which utilize tropes of landscape and figurative painting while denying representation - are depictions of abstract notions of spirituality, mythology, and the elemental (and often invisible) fabric of life manifested in physical forms.</p>

<p>Inspired by a range of esoteric sources that include Egyptian objects of worship, the films of Alexander Jodorowsky, the color theories of Rudolf Steiner, music from the 1960s, and the practice of worldly Asceticism, Leibowitz’s compositions are lush, spectral, and otherworldly. Rather than being reflections of objects as seen by the eye, the works are conduits that allow viewers to open themselves to higher powers - earth, wind, fire, water, and depending on one’s own belief system, the deities that weave the web that connects everything, including our souls, to the natural world.</p>

<p>TIM BERG &amp; REBEKAH MYERS - ON THE BRINK</p>

<p>Continuing with their exploration of ideas of material value and the consequences of the actions we take to satisfy
our desires, Berg-Myers have created a new body of works. This current exhibition is meant to provide the viewers with objects-situations where our choices are put to the test in how we understand the value of the things we do.<br>Some of the works in the exhibition have titles such as “All that glitters” and “As good as gold” which echo marketing tools employed in our contemporary culture to attract with a promise of guaranteed satisfaction if consumed.</p>

<p>Other works, such as “Against the tide “ and “Souvenirs” are examples of how the polar bear could become extinct do to our treatment of the environment. Eventually nature will remain present in our culture in the form of manmade objects that represent what once was real. These man-made objects end up in our homes where we will value them without realizing that they represent the real thing.</p>

<p>GREG DRASLER - ON THE LAM</p>

<p>Drasler, in these highly polished uncanny paintings, constructs the elsewhere and disruptions of travel as if reinventing the wheel. With auto interiors, patterns and suspended objects, the manifold directions of the imagination is a back seat driver steering into bursts of symbolic coincidence. The objects have the capacity of vehicles and the vehicles are all interior. Littered with cameras, trailers, books, tents and a ski lift, the paintings remain unusually vacant yet preoccupied. This pile up of instruments, tools, patterns and apparel accumulates and reads as words in a sentence, a visual sentence, which is the painting.</p>

<p>Taking its title from the largest painting in the show the exhibition insinuates encampment as a destination. On the Lam (70 x 160 inches) is crowded with trailers, tents and wagons that attract with a variety of doors, windows, vents and flaps. In the constructed panoramic sky, complete with camp fire plume, hovers a bicycle wheel, either spun out or loosened from its sprockets. In the place below, where the rubber hits the road, the painting gives us means-to-move and places-to-be.</p>

<p>CHRIS BARNARD - TOWARD TRINITY</p>

<p>Toward Trinity continues Chris Barnard’s personal and passionate exploration of the gap between the visible and invisible aspects of military representations and war time realities. Questioning the systems that celebrate destructive force and technological achievement, and the subversive measures used to eclipse the darker side of imperialist motives, Toward Trinity offers a fresh exploration of power and spectatorship.</p>

<p>It is an examination of contemporary American culture - one that is increasingly in a state of militarization and perpetual war - questioning the underlying structures of power that are framing the discussion and our understanding of these issues. Barnard implicates the role of art and visual culture in the process of social conditioning, exposing strategies that paradoxically disguise while also disclosing information.<br>Employing techniques and mechanisms inherent to different pictorial traditions, such as history painting (popularly utilized to glorify imperial conquests), American 19th-century landscape painting (used to invoke Manifest Destiny, an ideological dominion over the land), and European religious paintings (produced to convey reverence and incite obedience), Barnard’s new work addresses the contentious relationship between the veneration of the American military-industrial complex and the ecological damage and human suffering caused by it.</p>

<p>FERTILITY</p>

<p>Fertility, in all its literal or metaphoric meanings, is cyclic and timeless. At its most basic, to be fertile is to bear fruit-whether humans making children or the land producing crops. In a broader sense, fertility speaks to inventiveness, abundance, possibilities, ideas. Involved in the show are works from Marina Abramovic, Jonathan Borofsky, Louise Bourgeois, Tracey Emin, George Grosz, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Otto Mueller, Pablo Picasso, Auguste Rodin, Andres Serrano and Daniel Spoerri.</p>

<p>Grouping works dating from the late 19th century to the contemporary moment by eleven artists, the show looks at its theme from many angles - factual and symbolic, erotic and tender, visceral and humorous. The contemporary artist Marina Abramovic immediately commands attention with the assertiveness of her female imagery. Abramovic's 2005 chromogenic print "Women in Rain #2," taken from her video piece "Balkan Erotic Epic," shows traditionally dressed village women in a field lifting their skirts and thrusting their exposed vaginas to the heavens. In equal parts startling and comic, the image is part of Abramovic's exploration of ancient Balkan beliefs in the power of human genitalia to ensure the fertility of the land.</p>

<p>RICHARD PRINCE - THE FUG</p>

<p>Prince’s art frequently takes as its subject peripheral aspects of American culture, both high and low, and transforms them into a medium. Whether "Borscht Belt" jokes, car and motorcycle enthusiasm, pulp-literature or celebrity, his material is sourced from the underbelly of society. Prince takes aim at the vulgar, revealing culture’s indiscretions—misogyny, consumerism, exhibitionism and idealized desire. However, as a critique it is ambiguous in that it is accompanied by an equal dose of sympathy and obsession. That said, Prince is not confined to the low. He is equally versed in the high art of de Kooning, Pollock and Picasso, not to mention literary tradition. As Robert Rubin writes “He appropriates an era and makes something that resonates differently for different people. The beauty of Richard Prince’s art is that it doesn’t have limits.”</p>

<p>Prince is an avid collector and curator of Americana.  In selecting or regroupings images, whether they be rephotographs of advertisements of luxury pens, living room sets, the Marlboro Man, or forged publicity photographs, extracting them from their source, Prince elevates them to the status of fine art. Having been sourced for his palette, Prince’s subjects are recycled to fit into the framework of the artist’s diverse repertoire.<br>One may consider, for example, the title of this exhibition, which references the lesser-known American band The Fugs, founded in the early 1960s. Noted for their participation in the anti-Vietnam movement and alternative intellectualism, they were also allied closely with the Beat Generation, another of Prince’s longstanding references. The band can be found in the series Untitled (1,2,3,4), which groups together images in a gang-like fashion.</p>

For over thirty years these “3 Kings” have been at the top of the game, Fred Brathwaite aka Fab 5 Freddy, Lee Quinones and Leonard Mcgurr aka Futura 2000.<br>
Their history-making rise to international prominence from the subway tunnels of New York City was recently chronicled in MOCA’s “Art In The
Streets” exhibition.</p>

<p>RICHARD JACKSON - THE LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM</p>

<p>The Little Girl's Room, an exhibition of new work by Richard Jackson. His first solo gallery exhibition in Los Angeles in 20 years, the show is a significant milestone for an artist whose work has continually expanded and redefined the physical and conceptual reach of painting since the 1970s.</p>

<p>The work's centerpiece is a monumentally-scaled sculpture of a unicorn balanced on its horn, embraced by a life-size sculpture of a strangely doll-like little girl, that spins atop a motorized platform. Like many of the objects that Jackson has developed over the course of his career, the piece will be activated at the time of its installation in the gallery space. As it spins, paint will be pumped through the horse's genitals and spray and drip across the other elements of the installation. These include the large-scale canvases that depict fluffy clouds and geometric forms borrowed from Frank Stella, as well as an array of other objects that feel at once familiar and disturbingly out of place in the context of a child's room.</p>

<p>The sculptural figures that serve as both sources and supports for paint represent extremes of physicality in which the infantile and the archaic resemble each other. A larger-than-life Jack-in-the-box will be draped over one of the gallery's trusses, and when activated will emit paint downward from the pointy tip of its hat; a hobby horse, its head lodged in a bucket of paint, will rock back and forth, dumping the bucket's contents onto the floor around it; a sculpture of a baby will sit with a collection of baby bottles, filled and overfilled with paint; and, half-hidden in a closet, a comically aroused clown will communicate an aura of unsuccessfully repressed sexuality.</p>

<p>Exhibition runs through to October 20th, 2011</p>

<p>JOHN RITTER - WORKED UP</p>

<p>Ritter's politically and emotionally charged works utilize the vernacular of the information age to create vibrant images of politics,
celebrity, crime, and catastrophe.
By exposing the inherent anxiety of today's world, these subversive works fashion unseen relationships and contexts through
humor and clever juxtaposition. Ritter's works are simultaneously complex and accessible, offering new political as well as artistic
possibilities.</p>

<p>Ritter studies and sources potential subjects from found photographs then manufactures compositional elements by layering and
combining his own original photography to make a fabricated context in which the subject matter exists. His work exists in its
purest form, as a digital configuration, that has been appropriated, reconfigured and recycled into a form that is humanly
expressive, provocative and consumable.</p>

<p>ANTONY MICALLEF - HAPPY DEEP INSIDE MY HEART</p>

<p>Vibrantly colourful yet sometimes deeply troubling, Micallef's canvases interweave social commentary with self-examination. Antony's work
is built upon the profound belief in the act of
markmaking; figures and faces loom through the veil of loose, confident, almost abstract brushstrokes that explore experiences of life in London through sensations of light and dark, mirrored in both his palette and his choice of imagery.</p>

<p>Focussing on the contradiction inherent to mass-consumerism, the artist satirizes the rampant social suspicion of multi-national brands while simultaneously being outwardly seduced by products and marketing. Basing his art on social commentary and selfexamination over propaganda and style, Micallef is a traditional fine artist, weaving elements of pop-art into his large canvases.</p>

<p>DONALD EVANS - SELECTED WORKS</p>

<p>Evans began painting stamps of imaginary countries as a child and a novice stamp collector, and revisited and developed the concept as an adult, as he traveled the world, eventually settling in Amsterdam. Evans’ imaginary countries are complete with their own history, geography, currency and customs. The artist recorded each stamp series in his Catalogue of the World, organizing the work as one would an actual stamp collection.</p>

<p>KAWS - HOLD THE LINE</p>

<p>In Hold The Line, a large group of tondo paintings feature extreme close-ups of the face of KAWSBob, a recurring subject in the works on canvas. The circular edges of the picture plane resonate with cartoonish facial features: the scaled-up, concisely-painted, hard-edged curves of eyelids, undulating nose, and blocky, rectangular teeth are zoomed and cropped to an extent that offers the face as a kind of color field.</p>

<p>Along with the existential emotive and psychotropic narrative avenues KAWS opens up for his altered versions of iconic animated characters, the artist's works also provide the viewer with a richly rewarding and expansive formal consideration.</p>

<p>Non-naturalistic color takes on new meaning in the case where there is no living, breathing, original referent for characters born of cell animation (such as SpongeBob SquarePants). Nevertheless, the unconventional palette in KAWS's paintings--from high impact contrasts to monochromatic use of fluorescents, primaries, and darker tones--simultaneously defamiliarizes the ubiquitous characters while accentuating the reductive geometric play that abounds in their volumes and surfaces. In recent paintings, figures seem buoyed in the zero-gravity aftermath of a cartoon explosion, entangled in a dynamic composition of unmoored planks, bricks, or tentacles of color.</p>

<p>JANE HAMMOND - LIGHT NOW</p>

<p>For many years, Hammond has incorporated a vernacular of found images throughout her mixed-media work. The result of a process of collecting, imagining, and combining, Hammond’s photo vernacular now consists of over 10,000 snapshots. Since 2005, she has drawn from the images to create photographic works—incisive and imaginative black-and-white compositions that employ classic formal concepts while challenging the notion of the photographic medium as representative of personal and cultural memory.</p>

<p>Hammond expands upon the photography to create what she calls the “dazzle paintings” for both the materials used and the phenomena that ensues. Consisting of hand-painted images derived from vernacular photos, the paintings bear a captivating surface of mica sheets with gold, silver, copper, and palladium metal leaf applied over Plexiglas. The dazzle paintings are both reflective and translucent and respond differently in various light conditions and from different vantage points. As light strikes and penetrates the layered surfaces and elements come forth and disappear as the viewer’s physical relationship to the work changes, the paintings present an immediate, interactive experience for the viewer.</p>

<p>MAGGIE MICHAEL - THERE IS NO RISING OR SETTING SUN</p>

<p>Her new work sees a further evolution in Michael’s oeuvre following the introduction of text-based works in her exhibition All at Once (2008). <br>
In There is No Rising or Setting Sun, text is both obscured and evident: “I incorporate the negative and positive shapes of letters in areas of paintings for an abstract recognition and texture, no pun intended. Sometimes, these areas are not saying anything; however, the letter shapes/negative spaces are familiar and exist not to be decoded, but there.” The work and spirit of Samuel Beckett are predominant, whether in appropriated text such as: “no symbols where none intended” and “The tears of the world are a constant quality …The same is true of the laugh,” or in a text-less painting referencing the curiosity of Beckett’s character Watt (from the novel of the same name), who tries to understand an abstract image. “Like abstract painting,” says the artist, “Beckett’s works are experienced, heard, and understood on instinct, pressingly (depressingly) open; the viewer fills in the spaces.”</p>

<p>GHOST - THEN AND NOW</p>

<p>It’s safe to say GHOST’s legendary status in the lore of NYC subway graffiti’s past was not achieved with some self-consciously plotted career path to art world success. In fact, GHOST was more concerned with the transgression than the aesthetics of letters at the time- and transgress he did. He hated the preciousness of some writers, and attributes his loose, un-planned, flowing style --that persists to this day-- to needing to get up and get away. When he later took to drawing, he elaborated on his own aesthetic and dark humor by creating crazily inventive and irreverent possibilities for his letters and characters. Soon after, he merged these  ink apparitions with his street-borne skills as a colorist, and has continued to enjoy a level of facility and mastery of these forms for some time now—and without the level of risk of the old days.</p>

<p>ZEVS - RERNAISSANCE</p>

<p>For Zevs, liquidating logos (chosen amongst the most powerful brands, leaders of their consumption fields: sport, food, fashion, etc.) was never a frontal attack on their power or against consumerism. The persuasion power that these brands hold is what fascinates the artist. His centers of analysis have therefore always been Humans and their ongoing confrontation with temptations – seduction acts from brands – in the city, in public spaces, and against which they fight….or not.</p>

<p>GEORGE HERMS - XENOPHILIA</p>

<p>George Herms: Xenophilia (Love of the Unknown) presents the work of legendary West Coast assemblage artist George Herms alongside the work of a younger generation of Los Angeles and New York artists, which is bringing new energy to the assemblage tradition.<br>
The exhibition features works from a circle of friends Herms found in Florence, as well as artists introduced to him by the exhibition curator, Neville Wakefield, including Rita Ackermann, Kathryn Andrews, Lizzi Bougatsos, Robert Branaman, Dan Colen, Leo Fitzpatrick, Elliott Hundley, Hanna Liden, Nate Lowman, Ari Marcopoulos, Ryan McGinley, Melodie Mousset, Jack Pierson, Amanda Ross-Ho, Sterling Ruby, Agathe Snow, Ryan Trecartin, Kaari Upson, and Aaron Young.</p>

<p>Ever since he first started exhibiting in Los Angeles in the late 1950s, George Herms has been a central figure in the development of so-called West Coast aesthetic. Influenced by a beat generation more attuned to the musical nuance of the everyday than the modernist requiem to order, Herms's commitment to counterculture is expressed through his use of impoverished materials and his rejection of compositional devices in favor of loose associations of materials and ideas.</p>

<p>KLARA KRISTALOVA</p>

<p>For this exhibition Kristalova presents new works in various mediums including ceramic, bronze, and works on paper in a setting envisioned to reflect the artist’s concept of an unsettling space. Kristalova has crafted the environment to create a surreal atmosphere that places viewers in a flux between a dreamy and surreal place, and an ordinary space where conversations and interactions occur. To achieve this effect, the artist has focused on lighting and has furnished the gallery with second hand furniture found at local flea markets.</p>

<p>Klara Kristalova draws inspiration from music, current events, and her daily surroundings to create figurative ceramic works that often mirror imagery from myths and old folk tales, and address themes surrounding oppression, anxiety and the sub-conscious. Exuding both an innocence and horror, Kristalova's uncanny sculptures portray adolescent girls and boys, often marked with exaggerated features or in the midst of transformation, and bring to mind memories of childhood fantasy, dreams and nightmares.</p>

<p>EMORY DOUGLAS</p>

<p>Emory Douglas is a pivotal figure in the development of political graphic art. Appointed ‘Minister for Culture’ for the Black Panthers in 1967, he became in-house illustrator for the quasi-revolutionary civil rights movement’s eponymous newspaper. Douglas’ instantly recognisable graphics filled the incendiary journal and would form its back page, a ‘cut out and paste up’ propaganda poster.</p>

<p>A cornerstone of the Black Panthers until their dissolution in the early 1980s, Douglas was one of the first agitants to use the visual language of the right wing to express the ideas of the left. His powerful pieces swapped hand-wringing for aggression and victim status for insurgency. Using a strong but consistent, simple yet brutal visual style Douglas’ artwork defined the Black Panther’s pride, resourcefulness and charisma. The illustrations’ accompanying battle cries, including ‘all power to the people’, ‘in revolution one wins and one dies’ and ‘seize the times’, entered the lexicon of a generation.</p>

<p>In and out of youth detention as a teen, Douglas kept busy working in the print shop of Ontario’s Youth Training School. Encouraged to draw by social workers, he went on to study commercial art at San Francisco’s community college, where he learned to use collage and what would today be called ‘found media’ to create high-impact pieces using minimal time and money.<br>
Employing a ‘DiY’ ethos to make potent, populist imagery re-enforced by slogans is a defining characteristic of many of today’s heralded street artists.</p>

<p>LYNDA BENGLIS</p>

<p>This travelling exhibition spans the range of Lynda Benglis's career, including her early wax paintings, her brightly colored poured latex works, the Torsos and Knots series from the 1970s, and her recent experiments with plastics, cast glass, paper, and gold leaf. It features a number of rarely exhibited historic works, including Phantom (1971), a dramatic polyurethane installation consisting of five monumental sculptures that glow in the dark, and the installation Primary Structures (Paula's Props), first shown in 1975.</p>

<p>Alongside her sculptural output, Benglis created a radical body of work in video, photography, and media interventions that explore notions of power, gender relations, and role-playing. These works function in tandem with her sculpture to offer a pointed critique of sculptural machismo and suggest a fluid awareness of gender and artistic identity. They also contribute to an understanding of the artist's objects as simultaneously temporal and physically present, intuitive, and psychologically charged.</p>

The show will be a playful take on running a skateboard shop, transforming I-20 into a functional retail space offering a custom line of artist-designed skateboards, skate-related ephemera and accessories, original artwork, vintage objects, custom furniture and clothing by up-and-coming New York designers.</p>

<p>A true working skate shop, Make Skateboards will offer decks that are fully skate-able yet designed to an artistic standard. Two types of boards will be available: affordable, limited-edition silk-screened skateboards; and one-of-a-kind decks altered and embellished by hand, including several conceptual takes on the idea of skateboarding itself.</p>

<p>Exhibition runs through to September 17th, 2011</p>

<p>DAN FISCHER</p>

<p>The drawings of Dan Fischer, meticulous graphite-on-paper recreations of widely known images of artists and their work, from the mid-twentieth century to the present day, are remarkably simple propositions that ask some of the most complex and profound questions about art and contemporary visual culture. <br>Whether based on iconic portraits of acclaimed artists, such as the photograph of Bridget Riley in the mid-1960s by John Goldblatt, or instantly recognisable images of an iconic artwork itself, such as Kurt Schwitters' The Merzbau, each drawing by Fischer takes a photographic image with unmistakable currency, circulation and meaning within narratives of contemporary art history, and refashions it as an object of art.</p>

<p>MICHELANGELO PISTOLETTO</p>

<p>For his exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery, the artist will create a new, site-specific installation using a form that he often returns to: the labyrinth. Pistoletto’s exhibition will draw visitors through the galleries, leading them via a winding maze to hidden installations and sculptures. Responding to the architecture of the Serpentine galleries and using an economy of materials, the exhibition will manipulate visitors’ perceptions of space, making them an integral part of the work itself.</p>

<p>He began as a painter in the mid-1950s, and in the 1960s received critical acclaim for his series of Mirror Paintings. These works broke down the traditional notions of figurative art, reflecting their surroundings and the viewer as a part of the image, linking art and life in an ever-changing spectacle.</p>

<p>In this exhibition, Shrigley presents two hundred drawings and an ensemble of sculpture: a dozen giant ceramic

A few lines, a few words and one finds oneself smiling. Daily situations or objects are seen differently, it is hard to enjoy a pint when you know that ants have sex in your beer, or to seriously watch Michael Jackson moonwalk once you have seen how Shrigley draws him.

<p>BOXI -TIME OF THE SIGNS</p>

<p>A master of stencil culture, Boxi creates boldly intuitive life size works that he exhibits on the streets and the white walls of galleries using
meticulous cutting techniques and an extensive pallet of muted colours. Turning away from the traditional anarchist use of stencils with simple designs and spray paint, Boxi challenges the norm through boldly heightened realistic figures within their own urban landscapes. With fear and the manipulation of fear as the underlying theme, his art channels a deeply disturbing voyeuristic experience for the viewer playing with the spatiality of the environment and the oscillating perception of the image.<br>
Boxi's use of the greyscale within his paintings, sculptures and meticulously detailed stenciled works consciously filter the gloss and spin of the present to a muted bass sense of now. Amidst all the doom and gloom there is a concealed light. The works are camouflaged in a romanticism that wouldn't exist were it not for failed dreams and flawed
excuses.</p>

<p>GREG GOSSEL - NUMB</p>

<p>The concept behind the work featured in Numb is rooted in Gossel’s social commentary on the over-saturation of visuals and information in contemporary culture – the numbing effect that it has on our minds, and the desire it creates for us to deaden our senses further (in some cases with chemical substances).</p>

<p>Gossel explores the former through a series of heavily layered panels, covered in cultural ephemera, weathered away in areas to reveal high-end luxury logos and cultural symbols, and the latter though a collection of hard-edged mixed-media portraits of 20th century pop culture icons who have fallen victim to their own overblown, all-consuming celebrity: including Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and Jimi Hendrix, among others.  Money, fame and tragedy are overarching themes within the series.</p>

<p>RONI HORN - RECENT WORK</p>

<p>The exhibition features important new sculpture, photography and works on paper. Through these media, Horn cultivates a complex relationship between identity, location and the viewer's perception Horn has made a new sculpture.</p>

<p>Horn has made a new sculpture for the north gallery. Consisting of a group of six to ten ethereal yet weighty pieces, this work is the first of Horn's multi-part sculptures to be shown in the UK.</p>

<p>In the south gallery, Horn has created part two of a key work in her oeuvre: 'You are the Weather' (1994 – 1996). The new work, 'You are the Weather, Part 2', follows the same form as 'You are the Weather' and features the same model, 15 years later. The work consists of 100 photographs of a woman, situated in the hot springs and pools in Iceland. In each image, the woman's facial expressions change with the changes in the weather conditions around her. As described by Horn in regards to 'You are the Weather', 'The way this work is shot and installed, the viewer is voyeurised by the view. You are surrounded by a woman who is staring at you'.</p>

<p>In connection with 'You are the Weather, Part 2', Horn will publish 'Haraldsdóttir, Part Two'. This publication is the 10th volume of 'To Place' – an ongoing series of artist's books. It is related to 'Haraldsdóttir', which was first published in 1996, and presents in the work all the photographs from 'You Are the Weather, Part 2'.</p>

<p>CARLO MOLLINO - MANIERA MODERNA</p>

<p>The exhibition’s selection of works reflects the versatility of Carlo Mollino’s oeuvre: on view are his drawings and architectural plans, furniture and furnishings, Mollino’s race car "Bisiluro", his photomontages, Polaroids of female nudes, his essays on architecture,
photography and downhill skiing, as well as other archival material. A photographical essay by Armin Linke created for the exhibition provides an overview of Mollino’sconstructions and their state of preservation.<br>
Mollino’s buildings were long handled with negligence. It is significant that in 1960 the Turin city council voted to demolish the Società Ippica Torinese, which had only been completed in 1940. Although Carlo Mollino has gained increasing attention in recent years, he is still not fully recognized as an architect. In contrast, his furniture has long been on great demand by collectors: in 2005 one of his tables was sold at auction for 3.8
million dollars. Contemporary artists, such as Karole Armitage and David Salle, Nairy Baghramian, Steven Claydon, Armin Linke, Mai-Thu Perret, Heidi Specker and Simon Starling, refer explicitly in their work to Carlo Mollino.</p>

<p>PETER PERI  - WE, THE CHILDREN OF THE 20TH CENTURY</p>

<p>His work has been described, in the writings about him, as being in a dialogue with the now extinguished utopian ideals, or grand value systems, of early modernism, and the writers who have stated this are, of course, all correct in their description. It’s been noted that Peri’s grandfather was an early Constructivist and in a sense Constructivism is Peri’s inheritance fortune – the art historical equivalent of a decayed noble estate, amongst whose treasures Peri, the young heir, may wander, enjoying whatever uses or strange squanders that the rights of ownership allow him.</p>

<p>There is a vast, potent, teeming art historical energy about early modernism; it fascinates artists, and enthralls critics and art institutions. Modernism’s original formations suggested political utopianism, geometric spirituality, avant gardism and artistic heroism, cosmological searching, the coded systems of spiritualist and occultist empowerment, abstract and formalist absolutism, and ideals of social and scientific progressiveness. Peri’s appropriations of these (mostly ruined) modernist ideals could be just a cerebral, art historical exercise, or else an opportunity for playfully ironic, retro gags. But his geometrical modernist forms are better than either; propelled forth from a mostly poetic logic (as indicated in the painting titles), he creates the visual equivalences of intense, authoritative, summary moods. Peri’s is a cosmology of various sacred geometries – there are many sacred geometries around to choose from – which he allows to glisten in the brightness of a silvery honouring, before revealing something profane; a foul night time of the dissolute, created from the distressed grunge of painted and overpainted effacement.</p>

<p>JAKE &amp; DINOS CHAPMAN: JAKE OR DINOS CHAPMAN</p>

<p>For the past year, Jake and Dinos have been working in separate studios to produce a series of works in isolation from each other. Only in the staging of this show will each become aware of what the other has done. Unlike Gilbert &amp; George, for whom Jake and Dinos worked at times as studio assistants, their practice is not one of ‘singular duality’. They have always discussed, debated, argued and on occasion fought over creative and cultural ideas, but in this exhibition they will scrutinise and confront the whole idea of creative collaboration.</p>

<p>Jake and Dinos Chapman began their artistic collaboration after graduating from the Royal College of Art in London in 1990 when they created We are Artists. Since this self-defining anti-aesthetic manifesto was first stencilled onto a mud-splattered wall at the ICA, London in 1992 they have developed their own shared discourse as ‘sore-eyed scopophiliac oxymorons’ with, as they put it at the time, ‘a benevolent contingency of conceits’.</p>

<p>Over the last twenty years their practice has seen them make iconoclastic sculpture, paintings, prints and installations that examine, with searing wit and energy, contemporary politics, religion and morality. In the essay accompanying their survey show at Tate Liverpool in 2006, Christoph Grunenberg described the work as existing between that which repulses and that which attracts the viewer. Furthermore, he said that what becomes really disturbing is “the underlying psychological meanings – the attacks on the whole body, the blurring of gender lines, the revulsions of the abject, the insinuations of sadism and moral offences. While their sculptures, paintings and prints function perfectly on a visceral level without theoretical superstructure, particular figures, motifs and images can always be traced to specific textual and visual references.”</p>

<p>IMPRESSIONS FROM SOUTH AFRICA, 1965 TO NOW</p>

<p>During the oppressive years of apartheid rule in South Africa, not all artists had access to the same opportunities. But far from quashing creativity, these limited options gave rise to a host of alternatives, including studios, print workshops, art centers, schools, publications, and theaters open to all races; underground poster workshops and collectives; and commercial galleries that supported the work of black artists, that made the art world a progressive environment for social change. Printmaking, with its flexible formats, portability, relative affordability, and collaborative environment, was a catalyst in the exchange of ideas and the articulation of political resistance.</p>

<p>THE ART OF CLIMBING MOUNTAINS</p>

<p>"The Art of Climbing Mountains," a group exhibition inspired by an excerpt of René Daumal's " Mount Analogue" published in 1952. The works in this exhibition investigate a variety of positions and possibilities addressing the challenges of life and the way in which one addresses these challenges - surreal, metaphorical and otherwise. Daumal, the French Surrealist writer, was known for his allegorical novels and translations of sacred Buddhist texts. <br>The artists involved are Cevdet Erek, Adrian Ghenie, Adriana Lara, Mike Nelson and Joel Shapiro.</p>

<p>ANNE SCHNEIDER</p>

<p>In her most recent works Anne Schneider deliberately refers to the usual steel-reinforced concrete construction, sheathing iron rods in concrete, while at the same time giving the construction material the appearance of a soft textile and thus lending it an unusual familiarity. Thanks to the artist's handling of this cold and hard material it takes on tactile qualities: human traces, folds, curvatures and scars. Based on this initial sheathing, she had developed works that continue in diverse ways this interplay of material and effect, construction and furnishing, architecture and individual, past and present.</p>

<p>SHINTARO MIYAKE - CALM CLAM</p>

<p>Miyake's works characteristically tackle classical and mythological themes such as history and mythology. The exhibition at Gabriel Galerie Rolt is no exception,
concentrating on the opposing notions of fear and relief, which battle and tussle with each other across the frieze-like expanses of the works.
Miyake's work performs an important role in the Japanese New Pop art movement. As with previous series, for Galerie Gabriel Rolt he has created a specific iconography. A seated figure with a clam's head takes the centre of the drawings, each with Miyake's signature long and seemingly boneless arms. While working on a drawing Miyake always dresses up - like a puppet - taking on the character he is painting.</p>

<p>About this he has stated, "To wear the character costume is an expression of making a portrait of myself. I feel something is missing just showing a completed work." As such, Miyake's works only become whole through performance; the artist includes himself - quite literally - in their creation.</p>

<p>PATRICK MCMULLAN X FOOX</p>

<p>The show will comprise the Bunny and Rabbit artwork of Patrick McMullan and David Foox (FOOX). FOOX's bunny art relates to the more esoteric aspects of the human psyche. Specifically, the questions relating to consciousness, reality, and where do ideas come from? In celebration of The Year of the Rabbit and in deference to that secret place deep within all of us comes the Rabbit in a Business Suit straight out of the 4th Dimension. Ever so slightly psychedelic but mostly spiritu-philosophical, FOOX's Rabbits offer a glimpse into the world of an artist consumed by that blurred line between magical creation and concrete jungle.</p>

<p>POST 9-11</p>

<p>Post 9-11 is a group exhibition distinct of a decade and definitive of an era. The work of the nine artists represented (Dan Colen, Terence Koh, Hanna Liden, Nate Lowman, Adam McEwen, Ryan McGinley, Agathe Snow, Dash Snow, and Aaron Young) defies categorization into a particular movement or style, yet poignantly references a collective history through works of painting, photography, sculpture, and installation.</p>

<p>Practicing in the new millennium, these New York based-artists, friends and collaborators, are brought together by a sense of community and shared history. Their relationships with each other cemented fully over the last ten years – a decade spent sharing ideas, studios, apartments, and themselves. This intimate connection not only informed their respective practices, it also influenced their creative progressions. The loose society of downtown New York provides affirmation that the bond created making art together proved a powerful factor in the voice and vision of these artists.</p>

<p>SPENCER FINCH</p>

<p>Using light as his medium, Spencer Finch’s works deal with notions of perception and the experience of time. He keeps pursuing an ineffable moment where past and present, memory and instant meet; personal desire and world history collide.</p>

<p>After visiting loaded, historic places such as the cave of Lascaux, this new project relates to William Shakespeare play, Hamlet. Through an LED installation, Spencer Finch offers a sparkling fireflies night, each light playing a different character part, their intensity and movement representing each personality and move. Spencer Finch creates an atmosphere exalting mystery and fantasy - a dream place combining darkness and light, angst and delight. The arisen dichotomy is inspired by the 3rd act of Hamlet where the tension reaches its peak – the act shedding the light on the characters’ real nature, revealing its hero in the sublime of his existential contemplation (To be or not to be?) but also in the uttermost cruelty of his human condition.
Exploring through light the spiritual and emotional conflicts of each individual, Spencer Finch embraces a certain idea of romanticism and invites the audience to reflexion and introspection.</p>

<p>In this exhibition titled Corn, Tobacco and Other Stories, Guenther's subjects of work include; tobacco plants, corn stalks, women with paper plate faces, a whale, hot dogs, Grecian urns, the folds of the canvas itself, a silver sail; symbols from Guenther's personal lexicon alluding to both familiar and foreign stories. The artist used fewer than three colors for each of most paintings for this exhibition. The nature of the paintings' ground is allowed to be it's own color as is the texture of each material.</p>

<p>Guenther applied papier-mâché to his "plate face" paintings - which are white except for linen or chip - board peeking through in some areas. His drawings are papier-mâché figures in relief against dreamy watercolor grounds.</p>

<p>RON ENGLISH - SKIN DEEP</p>

<p>Painter, Pundit and Prankster Ron English presents Skin Deep, an exploration of the intersections, discrepancies and synchronicities of personal mythologies on display in our public personas. The exhibition presents multi-layered portraits of some of his most iconic characters, tracing the arc of their inner lives.
Often using his children as models, English chronicles the soul’s sojourn through Pop dioramas of fear and appetite, aspiration and rage. While paying homage to the great art before him, English maintains his very personal point of view, transforming the public to intimate and the universal to specific.</p>

<p>Using a mixture of imagery, medium and process referenced from great masters such as Warhol, Pollack and Picasso, combined with irreverent cherry-picking of populist totems from fast food to cartoons, English creates complex running narratives of his many alter-egos butting headfirst into the Grand Illusion, where unstated cultural norms are exposed and analyzed.</p>

<p>SHERRIE LEVINE - THE DESERT</p>

<p>In this new series of works, Levine continues and extends the conceptual trajectory of this act of referencing. Bobcat and javelina skulls cast in bronze recall her 2007 exhibition at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, where the artist has made a home, and where she showed a series of cattle skulls in clear reference to paintings by O’Keeffe. Here too the source of the work is a found object, and the artist shows the javelina skulls as a series, six sculptures from the edition in a row. Through this repetition, the sculpture becomes a reference to itself, and calls attention to the seriality central to the artist’s work.</p>

<p>Sherrie Levine came to prominence as one of a generation of artists who, during the 1970s and early 1980s, became known under the label of postmodernism. One of the characteristics of her work that drove critics at the time, Craig Owens in particular, to identify it as such was its use of appropriation. In his influential 1980 essay: The Allegorical Impulse: Toward a Theory of Postmodernism, Owens saw Levine’s use of appropriation as a strategy working against the Modernist imperative of originality and artistic genius.</p>

<p>NELLEKE BELTJENS - THEY DON´T KNOW EITHER</p>

<p>Since her first show “Fragments of the Parts” (2009), the artist has been consistently developing her unusual and idiosyncratic approach to drawing. Among the basic principles of her work is the fragmenting of the line, which is questioned as a fundamental drawing element, the artist breaking it up into numerous short marks that stand perpendicular to the extension of the line, thus transforming it into a rhythmic structure.<br>In turn, as a result of the countless superimposed “lines” running parallel and crosswise, structures come about that are difficult to define in terms of concept. They are full of movement, characterized by abrupt changes in direction and different degrees of intensity and density, whereby the positive forms are always confronted with the negative areas of the white drawing paper in a way that attributes both an equal value.</p>

<p>It is essential to the artist that her works may not be completely comprehended from any perspective view. Standing further away, the drawings are perceived as being rather vague due to the atmosphere they exude, though from close up they break up into countless individual elements, which we may no longer relate to one another.</p>

<p>JIM GAYLORD - SPOILERS</p>

<p>Gaylord's work draws upon abstracted imagery found within high-speed action sequences in motion pictures. He creates compositions by collecting film stills of fleeting shapes and special effects, using a computer to superimpose several frames together at once. These studies become the source material for paintings, resulting in something like a painted collage.</p>

<p>The title of the exhibition, Spoilers, refers to the concept of revealing plot elements in a film or story that give away the outcome, in part or in its entirety. Pitting this idea against itself, Gaylord's work foils the entire narrative format, offering specificity of form, while withholding information that would allow a traditional, linear understanding of the picture.<br>The source films range from period action dramas, such as "Troy" and "Pirates of the Caribbean," to MTV's "Jackass," "The Waterboy" and "World Trade Center." The genres of armed conflict and sports suggest a quasi pun for Spoilers, as in the "spoils" of war.</p>

<p>KATHARINA GROSSE</p>

<p>Grosse's most recent canvases combine a complex artistic vocabulary. Patterns of diagonal hatchings and closely set strips of color cross with delicate, almost transparent lines to form the basic rhythm. At the edges of the paintings, the structures open up, providing a view on their ground. One type of shape that frequently appears in Grosse?s works is the ellipses, which she employs as a convex, vaulted sculpture or as an image.<br>On the canvas, physical forces seem to affect its form. It can take on the soft appearance of a drop, apparently flowing vertically across the painting. Set in motion, it practically begins to swing, developing a palpable dynamic. With the help of ellipses-shaped stencils, individual areas are left open, while in other places, they overlap and permeate each other, becoming so dense that they seem to be imploding.</p>

<p>LARISSA BATES - SNAP AND GO</p>

<p>In her paintings a repeating cast of characters play out psychological dramas connected to families, care giving, and power. Investigation of gender roles is a central theme in these works, with a particular emphasis on social constructions of masculinity. The main protagonist of the narrative is the Mother Man character, depicted as a wrestler who embodies qualities that are very nurturing in addition to being athletic, heroic and noble. The Mother Men strive for pacifism, and often engage in wrestling with one another.</p>

<p>The topic of colonialism is another theme central to the paintings. Chiquita Banana Girls, who appear of the in her work, are seen carrying fruit through the landscapes. Bates is the great-granddaughter of George P. Chittenden, who was the vice president of the United Fruit Company, which controlled the banana trade in Costa Rica, from 1925 to 1932. The United Fruit Company brought schools, railroads, and industry to Costa Rica. But under complex circumstances. They implemented institutionalized racism, as workers of color were banned from the company. UFC was notorious for abusive labor practices and exploitation of the Costa Rican citizens and their land rights. As a descendant of both the colonized and the colonizers, Bates’ paintings explore the interdependence of these two groups.</p>

<p>JOHAN CRETEN - PLINY'S SORROW</p>

<p>Pliny's Sorrow is comprised of nine enigmatic bronzes, eight of which were specifically created for the exhibition. Creten, best known for virtuosic works in kiln-fired ceramics, particularly his flowering Odore di Femmina busts in terracotta, is also a master of lost-wax foundry casting in bronze, and this ambitious exhibition provides evidence of this on an unprecedented scale.<br>The exhibition’s title is borrowed from the largest work in the exhibition, an eagle-like bird, its giant wings stretched out and broken, its roughly hewn back hollowed out.</p>

<p>ABSOLUT 365 DAYS - 5 DAYS LA ROMA</p>

<p>5 Days La Roma explores one of the current global creative hotspots – Mexico City and its art scene. Starting on May 24, the vibrant La Roma neighborhood will see a series of art initiatives during a five-day event including globally-acclaimed artists Rirkrit Tiravanija, Miguel Calderon, Mario Garcia Torres, Laureana Toledo, Sam Samore, and Carl Michael
von Hausswolff – all presenting new works especially created for 5 Days La Roma.</p>

<p>The event in Mexico City is curated by Thomas Nordanstad within 365 Days – a continuous initiative where ABSOLUT explores creativity in places all over the world.<br>
The films that will be presented during 5 Days La Roma are the result of 365 Days curator Thomas Nordanstad getting in touch with the selected artists. He has given them the possibility to create
and present films and images together in a place where the art scene is currently at a peak. La
Roma (Colonia Roma) in Mexico City offers galleries, institutions, architecture and people, that
together have created an area that oozes creativity.
“Through 365 Days, we want to explore creativity in places where it flows, together with the
people that make it happen”, says Thomas Nordanstad, curator of 365 Days. “We chose Mexico
City and La Roma because it’s a place where creativity is at the edge of contemporary culture.
You can really feel it.”</p>

<p>TRACEY EMIN: LOVE IS WHAT YOU WANT</p>

<p>This is first major survey in London of the work of one of the UK’s most renowned and celebrated artists. The exhibition features key works from all periods of the artist’s career, including seldom-seen early works and more recent large-scale installations as well as a new series of outdoor sculptures created especially for the Hayward.</p>

<p>Some of the Highlights include, a series of 16 neon art works which illuminate emotions, memories, feelings and ideas, including a new heart-shaped neon Love is What You Want (2011) are displayed along a darkened wall evoking the atmospheric nightlife of bars, clubs and amusement arcades. The ashes of The Shop, the enterprise that Emin and Sarah Lucas set up together in the East End in 1993. For six months they made and sold their own merchandise. When The Shop closed Emin burnt its remaining contents so it could never be recreated and Running Naked (2000/2011) - a new photographic work which shows the artist running naked down an East London street, reworked from a film shot originally by her ex-boyfriend the artist Mat Collishaw in 2000.</p>

<p>DOMESTIC GOODS</p>

<p>“Domestic Goods,” is a group show organized by Ryan Wallace.
Mr. Wallace, a New York City artist who has been a Pollock-Krasner Foundation grant recipient, has included 27 contemporary artists in this show that addresses both the external and internal notions of domesticity: memory, family, comfort, or material surroundings. The artists are mostly culled from the neighborhoods of New York where emerging artists today make their home, such as Bushwick, Brooklyn.</p>

<p>ANISH KAPOOR - LEVIATHAN</p>

<p>Famed for his critically acclaimed Cloud Gate in Chicago and Sky Mirror in New York, Kapoor is the fourth artist to be invited by the Grand Palais to create the annual Monumenta exhibition in its vast, glass-roofed central nave.<br>
Inside Leviathan, the viewer is invited to take part in a physical and mental experience, a sensory immersion in a translucent membrane designed to interact with the architecture of the building in which it is housed.
The red glow is created by daylight flooding from the nave's glass roof and through the sculpture's tent-like walls, and its intensity, as well as the temperature in the cavity, vary as clouds pass over the sun.
From the outside, however, Leviathan offers a completely different experience, a feeling of awe at the overwhelming scale of the bulbous, rubber-like sculpture, which stands 35 meters (yards) high and fills the entire 35,000 sq meters (376,700 sq ft) of the nave.</p>

<p>SAM FALLS - SOMEWHERE TO GO</p>

<p>This exhibition, titled Somewhere to Go, presents three different series of work based on his interest in aesthetic trends in photography and their relation- ship to modernism/minimalism in painting and sculpture.</p>

<p>With one set of images, which Falls refers to as "construction paper fades," the artist experiments with analog photo- graphic processes that abandon traditional materials and methods. He uses colored construction paper, which he masks out certain areas of, then exposes it to direct sunlight. The portions of paper that have been covered (with abstract or geometric shapes) retain the original, saturated color of the paper, while the negative areas become faded - gradated, as the sun's intensity changes from traveling east to west.<br>
Moving away from paper entirely, Falls then turned to fabric. With this work, the artist hand-dyed large pieces of material, with grommets placed in the corners, which he then staked in a canyon outside of Los Angeles with two-by-four foot lengths of wood laid down the center. By leaving the fabric outside for a period of time, exposing them to the elements of wind, sun, sleet, and rain, the material (outside of where the wood covered it) tells a story of a specific place and time through its faded color and frayed edges.</p>

<p>DIANN BAUER</p>

<p>Diann Bauer turns the rhetorical excess of extreme-cum-mainstream contemporary political discourse back on itself. Using wall painting and a series of near illegible political signs and posters, Bauer ramps up the apocalyptic hysteria of right-wing libertarian movements whilst simultaneously laying-bare their proximity to left-wing traditions of protest.</p>

<p>The works accelerate the logic of spectacle driven politics to their maxed-out conclusion. Layering slogans from both the left and the right, Sarah Palin to The Red Army Faction, US Republican Congressmen to The Unabomber to The Invisible Committee; interlacing text and image, one sees the very principles of Western society being torn apart and mashed up, used and abused, regardless of their political thrust.</p>

<p>ART IN THE STREETS</p>

<p>Art in the Streets is the first major U.S. museum survey of graffiti and street art. Curated by MOCA Director Jeffrey Deitch and Associate Curators Roger Gastman and Aaron Rose, the exhibition will trace the development of graffiti and street art from the 1970s to the global movement it has become today, concentrating on key cities such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, and Sao Paulo, where a unique visual language or attitude has evolved.<br>The exhibition will feature paintings, mixed media sculptures, and interactive installations by 50 of the most dynamic artists and will emphasize Los Angeles's role in the evolution of graffiti and street art, with special sections dedicated to seminal local movements such as cholo graffiti and Dogtown skateboard culture. A comprehensive timeline illustrated with artwork, photos, video, and ephemera will provide a historical context for the work.</p>

<p>STEVE TOBIN : STEELROOTS</p>

<p>Steve Tobin's sculptures are a dramatic fusion of nature and art.  Set among the Arboretum's glowing gardens and peaceful groves, they invite you to touch, stroll through or even lie down beneath them, to discover your own unique views of the land around you, views that change with the light and the seasons.</p>

<p>Steve Tobin gained international acclaim in 2004 with the dramatic installation of the Trinity Root sculpture near Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan, the first and only art memorial near the 9/11 disaster site. The sculpture is a bronze casting of the stump and roots of the historic sycamore tree that saved St. Paul's Chapel during the attack on the World Trade Center. The transcendent sculpture is permanently sited on the corner of Wall Street and Broadway where millions of visitors see it each year.</p>

<p>PAUL MCCARTHY : SELECTED WORKS</p>

<p>Paul McCarthy's career, spanning over forty years of production, can at once be summarized as chaotic, grotesque, and provocative. His work stems from an adolescence in American popular culture saturated with corn syrup, ketchup, and coca cola, childrens' toys and Disney - materials and references which act as sweetened and cheapened metaphors for the very most basic elements of human life: sweat, blood, sex, desire, feces.</p>

<p>McCarthy's world -as represented through his work- is cruel and euphoric but oddly familiar, often taking the form of a skewed allegory or fairytale (Pinocchio or Heidi, for example). His adaptations of these stories methodically predict human excess, spilling proverbial guts and blood to cut to the quick of human tendencies universally recognized but hardly spoken of. Throughout, an insistent question of the role of the artist is posed. Rejecting the idea of artist as mystic, McCarthy plays the parody, repeating and re-interpreting the images he grew up with by approaching their limits.</p>

<p>FLORIAN MAIER-AICHEN</p>

<p>With the works in this exhibition, Maier-Aichen continues his practice of picking apart and expanding notions of photographic representation. Many works in the show rely on a fully hybrid model of image production; utilizing practices of photography, painting and drawing in equal measures has allowed the artist to explore the myth of image-making in pursuit of a new form of the ideal photographic document.<br>Through the subtle interventions and a shrewd utilization of the visual / conceptual crossover, the works push toward a simultaenous rejection and embrace of the confines of photographic reality, all the while celebrating the romance of image creation.</p>

<p>NOH, SANG-KYOON : CONJURING CONSTELLATIONS</p>

<p>Noh, Sang-Kyoon chooses to follow his personal mythos as a source and driver for his creative process. Covered in thousands of sequins that he threads together by hand, the early sculptures and canvases of Noh, Sang-Kyoon trace their origins to both the ordinary and the spiritual-from the memory of his mother's spangled bag and the costumes of singers on television, to a near-death childhood experience, when he nearly drowned. He realized then that he "could die in vain, as nobody, as nothing, with no purpose, as if a fish without scales that is doomed to perish." He later translated these memories into a series of early work where sequins created the shining appearance of life-saving fish scales.</p>

<p>FRANCESCA LOWE - HEADLAND</p>

<p>A modern reinterpretation of the ancient Three Graces myth is the subject of the exhibition by Francesca Lowe.<br>
In mythology the Three Graces are goddesses of unearthly attraction, beauty, and charm; men wanted them and women wanted to be them.  Throughout art history women have been painted from the male perspective and are usually depicted as being aware of the male spectator.  Lowe’s Graces flout this tradition.   The viewer is surrounded by the dramatic, large-scale canvases, executed in Lowe’s distinctive pastel with fresco-like washes.  This is an arena of intimidation, spectatorship and judgment, the domain of a coven-like ménage of five women.</p>

<p>SHEPARD FAIREY - THE PRINT SHOW</p>

<p>From his beginnings in the 1990s, Shepard Fairey has always considered posters as a valuable art support. His posters bear his graphic signature, instantly recognizable, memorable for his frequent use of black, white and red.<br>
They illustrate the richness in the artist’s sources of inspiration. Shepard Fairey makes reference to the Soviet propaganda, as well as to the psychedelic rock posters or the American cultural heritage.In his works, Shepard Fairey uses strong messages to make us think. His messages are often political, always committed and aim to demonstrate the all-power of the mass-media in our society by using their own code. From his manifesto written in 1990, Shepard Fairey said " The sticker has no meaning but exists only to cause people to react, to contemplate and search for meaning in the sticker ".</p>

<p>ANNA TUORI - TELL YOU LATER, DEAR</p>

<p>Tuori's works have always been characterized by the conflicting nature of their internal emotional states – the blending of innocent, childlike observations, lightness and beauty with a feeling of expectation and threat. Tensions which are difficult to express verbally but which the viewer will recognize and know.</p>

<p>Tuori's latest paintings are even more cogent than before. Their manner of execution is, on the one hand, fearless, almost bold, while on the other hand extremely sensitive and sensuous. Their subject matter comes from the boundaries of dream and reality, their conception of time is episodic, and they are of incommensurate scale. Despite these polarities, Anna Tuori's paintings are complete and balanced works giving the viewer the opportunity for a total, integrated experience.</p>

<p>SAGE VAUGHN - CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOOD</p>

<p>Children of a Lesser God furthers the artist's exploration into notions of control and release as well as the fundamental need for survival, love and liberty. Vaughn's new works manifest these concepts through bleak, dystopian cityscapes juxtaposed with child-like imagery and untouched scenes of nature.</p>

<p>Through the contrast of minutely detailed wildlife and child superheroes against urban backdrops, Vaughn's new body of work provides an eerily familiar setting that both comforting and inspiring to his audience.</p>

<p>ANNIE LAPIN - THE PURE SPACE ANIMATE</p>

<p>In The Pure Space Animate, there is less occasion for the multi-figure groups and enigmatic narratives of previous works, with further prominence shifted to the intensive formal activity.<br> The coherent scenic space and figural focal points which remain are yet more densely encircled and perforated by painterly forces that counteract their legibility, leaving the viewing experience characteristically unstable. One seeks and temporarily sees indications of illusionistic space - a horizon line, a column, the shadow of a tree - only to find that it behaves instead the next moment as a collection of sinuous ribbons of paint bound to the surface.<br>And it is this contrasting visual interpretation, this unresolved chord, that Lapin seeks to strike in the interest of a phenomenological experience of works as "constantly emerging" for the viewer.</p>

<p>ART, ACCESS &amp; DECAY : NY 1975-1985</p>

<p>This exhibition focuses on a art movement that emerged in New York at this time, uninfluenced by commercial or academic input. This new movement wanted to avoid the elite confines set by the art market, and made little compromise. These artists wanted to produce artwork nobody had seen before but everybody could understand. They presented this artwork on the streets, in makeshift storefronts, and on public access television to ensure that it was widely available.</p>

<p>Artists include John Ahearn, Liza Bear, Andrea Callard, Thom Corn, Jody Culkin, Jane Dickson, Stefan Eins, Coleen Fitzgibbon, Mike Glier, Robert Goldman, Ilona Granet, Keith Haring, Julie Harrison, Jenny Holzer, Becky Howland, Lisa Kahane, Christof Kohlhofer, Joe Lewis, Michael McClard, Ann Messner, Richard Miller, Joseph Nechvatal, Tom Otterness, Cara Perlman, Virge Piersol, Walter Robinson, Judy Ross, Christy Rupp, Teri Slotkin, David Wojnarowicz and Martin Wong</p>

<p>ROB FISCHER</p>

<p>In this exhibition Fischer presents three sculptures that further develop and explore themes seen throughout his work. The artist recently participated in the Hammer Projects series, installing a major sculptural work on the museum's lobby wall.<br>For years Fischer has reclaimed wooden floorboards from school gymnasiums throughout the Midwest. In his project at the Hammer he created a mural-like wall sculpture that existed as a labyrinth of roadways and paths of intersecting floorboards that refer back to the notion of the American road trip and an almost haphazard journey through nostalgia.</p>

<p>Here Fischer presents a work from this series, a wall sculpture that serves as a fragment of the larger floorboard installations. In this work it is as if the artist has taken a snap shot of a metaphorical roadmap as the work snakes down the wall into a corner and onto the floor, ending mid-path. Further fragmenting familiar objects Fischer presents two sculptures referencing a normative form, the boat.</p>

<p>PHILIP TAAFFE</p>

<p>Taaffe’s paintings are the slow product of wide-ranging meditations on the interrelation of forms and images in art, nature, architecture, and archaeology. Filtered through a critical and dynamic relation to the history of abstract painting, Taaffe’s oeuvre is remarkable for its visual exuberance and intricate craft.<br>In a single work he might combine the gestural impulses of Action Painting with the mechanical processes of silk-screening, as well as relief printing, marbleizing, traditional gold-leaf illumination, and subtle collage processes that are entirely of his own invention. Through these elaborate methods he composes dazzling schemes of great eloquence and beauty, often combining deeply personal visual reflections with quotations and vestiges drawn from a vast array of world cultures.</p>

<p>RICHARD SERRA - DRAWINGS</p>

<p>Throughout his career, Serra has made drawings as separate, immediate, and fundamental lines of investigation to his sculptures. They are explorations in their own right, integral to the overall concerns of his sculptural practice, and unique intuitive explorations within their own established criteria. Using black paintstick or oilstick, heated to a viscous and sometimes fluid state, he creates elemental forms through direction action on the paper and the accretion of medium. These drawings are self-referential: they do not imply surface and weight but rather they are surface and weight.<br>
All drawings by Richard Serra, executed between 2007 and 2010.</p>

<p>GONZALO PAPANTONAKIS</p>

<p>In this exhibition Papantonakis repeats images obsessively. Flora, images of childhood, and musical elements recur with near compulsive frequency throughout the artist’s oeuvre. The species of flower used in his motifs often varies from series to series, however one finds constancy in the freeform manner in which they are depicted. Papantonakis’ latest works are strewn with images of roses, however they appear alongside what is almost a catalog of flowers drawn from the artist’s previous pieces.</p>

<p>Evocations of childhood are found throughout Papantonakis’ canvases in the recurrence of images such as bike helmets, ballerinas and video‐game controllers. Many works incorporate collage and a rough handling of form, which communicates a sense of youthful spontaneity.</p>

<p>BEN QUILTY - INHABIT</p>

<p>Ben Quilty's recent suite of paintings, Inhabit, 2010, demonstrate an important culmination in his work as it explores wider concepts of identity.  Quilty, a distinguished portraitist, arrived at the multi-part epic in an attempt to reconcile his identity as a white Australian.  Conceived as a self-portrait, Inhabit also acts as a collective national portrait and could arguably be considered a barometer of domestic sentiment as the Australian reconciliation movement progresses.</p>

<p>REVOLUTIONS - SHEPARD FAIREY</p>

<p>Revolutions, a project featuring the Album Cover Art of Shepard Fairey, will consist of over 80 pieces of Punk, Rock, New Wave, Jazz, and Hip-Hop inspired artwork based on the 12" record cover format.</p>

<p>“Long before I knew about art galleries or even street art, I was excited about album cover art, if only because it was the visual counterpart to the music on the records. Album covers conjured a euphoric association with the listening experience. Most of my earliest home-made tee shirts were stencils based on punk album covers. I've had some very moving encounters with art in my life, especially in the street, but nothing can compare with the first time I heard the boots marching and first chord of the Sex Pistols' "Holidays in the Sun," or the air raid sirens leading into "too black, too strong" on Public Enemy's It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, or the opening guitar scream of Black Flag's "Rise Above".<br>That music makes my arm hairs stand up. Music is visceral and accessible, but also has the additional powerful layers of the lyrics with their content and politics, the style and personalities of the musicians, and the politics of their lifestyles. No matter how much I love art, or try to convince myself of its relevance in society, the fact remains that music is a lot cooler and way more able to reach people's hearts and minds... but I'm a populist and I look at this way: I may not play an instrument, but I'm gonna rock it hard as nails anyway.<br>Revolutions is a celebration of all the great music and accompanying art that has inspired me over the years.”

<p>ELLEN PHELAN - LANDSCAPES AND STILL LIFES</p>

<p>Ellen Phelan’s recent landscapes and still-life paintings completed between 1997 and 2010 flicker in and out of focus between realism’s sharp relief and abstraction’s gestural mark, between observations made from life and references to the photographic image.</p>

<p>In Woods (Westport), the earliest of the paintings on display, the suggestion of an entire forest is expressed through minimal brushwork, revealing her lineage in abstraction. As Phelan moves between mediums, she explores the formal and psychological implications attainable with each. The watercolor, gouache and pastel on paper Peonies and Quail on Mantel obscures the subject then pulls it back into clarity. For the oil on linen version, she allows the forms to be fully realized as representations of a domestic still life.</p>

<p>ANTHONY MCCALL - WORKS ON PAPER</p>

<p>Over the past five years McCall has explored solid-light works that are oriented vertically – projecting downwards from the ceiling onto the floor, forming 10-metre tall, conical ‘tents’ of light, with a base of about 4 metres. Here, the projected line-drawing on the floor is, quite literally, the footprint of the work, with the three-dimensional ‘body’ rising up from the floor and finally narrowing to a point at the lens of the projector, well-above one’s head. From the point-of-view of the observer, the vertical pieces create a profoundly different type of encounter. Four of these works, each of them showing in the UK for the first time.</p>

<p>JAMES JEAN - REBUS</p>

<p>Rebus, the new exhibition by Los Angeles based artist James Jean.  For this new body of work, Jean will present paintings, drawings and a wall installation.<br>
The subject matter is a fictionalized subconscious representation of deities in an apocalyptic decaying romanticized setting. Jean's visual symbolism is composed of an amalgamation of lyrically gestural, expressionistic, energetic, abstracted forms from highly detailed images to freely inscribed graffiti.
The solidity of the paint belies the illusory nature of the narrative: these excavations into the subconscious are fraught with the misfires, inconsistencies, and contradictions of a dream." James Jean
Jean's automatistic and narrative approach is informed by popular culture derived from his comic book and illustrative mastery.  His idiosyncratic language is based on references in historical and contemporary art.</p>

<p>DAVE WHITE - AMERICANA</p>

<p>Exploring iconic imagery of the Western Frontier, this exhibition highlights Dave White’s ability to capture dynamic scenes with his distinctive impasto style, while presenting a pioneering approach to documenting the legacy of this era.
The golden age of the Western movie era is encapsulated in Dave White’s series of Technicolour oil paintings. High energy scenes, dramatic tension and sweeping Western backdrops could be said to be White’s innovative interpretation of the classic film still. The cultural inspiration of this period is evident in the apocalyptic themes of battles and stand offs. The turbulence and explosive movements are animated and presented through chaotic brushstrokes and the continuous energy of an artist dedicated to his own battle with the canvas.</p>

<p>SCOTT CAMPBELL - NOBLESSE OBLIGE</p>

<p>New York based artist Scott Campbell expands his use of cut currency, sourcing uncut sheets of dollars directly from the United States Mint, to create large, intricate work with a sunken relief effect. One piece uses $5,000 worth of currency sheets to create an over two-foot cube, into which a three dimensional skull is carved-out. These works employ the familiar blue-collar vernacular of tattoo flash-boards - a skull smoking a cigarette, a skeleton's hand in a provocative gesture, a single eye emitting a penetrating ray - and highlight the irony that exists within that imagery.</p>

<p>Noblesse Oblige also includes a suite of prints. Using a tattoo gun, Campbell has engraved a collection of copper plates to make a group of etchings. By using the same plates to compose the separate prints, the artist plays with visual semantics - how meaning changes through arrangement. A series of drawings, executed onto the interior of ostrich eggshells, also flirt with interpretation. Morbid images, rendered in graphite onto these fragile surfaces that represent birth and transformation, point out the delicacy of opposition.</p>

<p>The title Noblesse Oblige implies that whoever claims to be noble must conduct their life accordingly, and in a manner that conforms to one's position.</p>

<p>NANCY SPERO</p>

<p>The Serpentine Gallery presents an exhibition of the celebrated American artist Nancy Spero, the first major presentation following her death in autumn 2009.Artist and activist Nancy Spero (1926–2009) was a leading pioneer of feminist art. During her 50-year career, she created a vibrant visual language constructed from the histories and mythologies of past and present cultures.
Trained in the figurative tradition, Spero was greatly influenced not only by the enduring dialogue with her husband Leon Golub, but also by artists including Jean Dubuffet and by the objects and artefacts she discovered in ethnographic museums. Spero rejected the dominant post-war movements of formalist Abstraction and Pop Art in the 1950s, developing a more ephemeral way of working that used paper and collage, gouache and printmaking – a process she described as allowing for ‘all manner of processions, conflicts, interruptions and disruptions’.</p>

<p>STANLEY DONWOOD - WORKS ON PAPER</p>

<p>Work on Paper, a solo exhibition by the artist Stanley Donwood.  Donwood will showcase a selection of rare print editions and original drawings on paper.  Included in this selection are  up to 13  brand new exclusive prints,  as well as never before seen prints from his most acclaimed series namely ‘Atoms For Peace’, ‘London Views’ and ‘Twisted Woods’. <br>
Renowned for his collaboration with Radiohead, Stanley has created all the band’s artwork from their second album on.  Yet, Donwood’s evocative and haunting imagery reaches far beyond band’s brand, which he helped to catapult to international stardom.</p>

<p>Interweaving meditative illustrations with propagandist text and graphics, his work’s potency lies in the unique pairing of deeply personal emotions and political themes alongside an inherent sense of reserved wit.  This winning combination allows for the examination of grave subjects not entirely seriously but without a doubt respectfully.</p>

<p>SIMON STARLING - RECENT HISTORY</p>

<p>In his first major UK exhibition since winning the Turner Prize in 2005, Starling employs video, film, slides, photography and sculpture to aid his understanding of the material world. Constructing a replica of the Pier Art Centre gallery space in Stromness, his exploration of the relationship between culture and nature is an uncanny one. <br>The exhibition will also include The Long Ton 2009, a sculpture featuring two rough-cut white lumps of marble suspended in space and Red Rivers, 2008 a video work which brings together the stories of two journeys made a century apart: the first a nineteenth century anthropological expedition into the Congo to capture and document the elusive and little known Okapi; the second a journey made by Starling down the Hudson River in a handmade strip canoe, culminating at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City where specimens of the Okapi finally ended up in a famous ‘diorama’. Taking the form of a series of still images, the video is as much a meditation on the fast disappearing processes of photography itself.</p>

<p>RICHARD PHILLIPS - MOST WANTED</p>

<p>Phillips’ strikingly distinctive paintings are drawn from found imagery, which he uses to address the marketability of our wishes, identity, politics, sexuality and mortality. He translates these images into drawings before executing large-scale oil paintings through a traditional process. He thus examines the iconic nature of pictures, which the media and art world use daily, each according to its own agenda.<br>
For ‘Most Wanted’, Richard Phillips selected ten of America’s most instantly recognisable celebrities from the realms of television, cinema and music to create distilled portraits of young, powerful stars exhibiting their rehearsed, red-carpet expressions. Phillips’ two-metre high canvases of Chace Crawford, Kristen Stewart, Zac Efron, Miley Cyrus, Taylor Momsen, Dakota Fanning, Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Timberlake, Taylor Swift and Robert Pattinson.</p>

<p>THE FACT OF THE MATTER - JESSICA LABATTE - ALI BAILEY</p>

<p>Material and materialism brings together two young artists Ali Bailey and Jessica Labatte. Whose interest in consumer culture and physical form, whose work revolves around the surprising, playful and sometimes unsettling transformation of found objects.<br>
Ali Bailey's work tackles advertising and branding culture. Jessica Labatte's photographs manipulate space and form. Some turn mundane objects found in thrift stores into beautiful, unrecognisable, abstract compositions.</p>

<p>JIM DINE SCULPTURES</p>

<p>Dine has been a major force across the contemporary scene since the advent of the Pop Art movement. Celebrated for his paintings and graphic work, Dine’s equally prolific and profound efforts as a sculptor are less well-known.<BR>
The exhibition traces the origins of Dine’s sculpture from the early work of the late 1950s and the early 1960s through his most recently completed efforts. Many of Dine’s iconic themes are explored including his use of tool and tool imagery, the Venus figure and the heart motif. Most recent is his exploration of the Pinocchio theme.</p>

<p>“Dine has a vast creativity and willingness to turn to a variety of images, many derived from found objects and popular or consumer culture,” said Joseph Becherer, Vice President and Chief Curator of Sculpture. “His sensitivity for textures and surfaces coupled with his mastery of materials allows him to create works in a range of materials from cloth to bronze, straw to wood.” 
With more than 20 works, it is Dine’s largest sculpture exhibition to date.</p>

<p>In The Belle of the Brawl, the artist continues his ongoing examination of the sociopolitical patterns of repetitive historical mistakes.  As the dust settles from the war in Iraq, the anxiety of crisis looms large over Afghanistan.  The artist seeks to address the pending inevitability of violence and destruction through a visual examination which will include iconographic imagery from the artist’s earlier work: herons, buffalo and WWII weaponry, while introducing a new assembly of symbols and motifs.   The exhibition will feature over 20 mixed media works on found wood as well as a transformational approach to 941Geary’s 3,000 square foot space with a 16’ x 46’ ft installation piece and a second clandestine installation to be unveiled at the opening reception.  </p>

<p>HAJIME SORAYAMA EXHIBITION</p>

<p>Beginning with paintings on paperboard from the 1970’s and extending into his most recent pieces, the exhibition highlights several bodies of work, all created by hand in acrylic with several different recognizable techniques. Sorayama’s famous Gynoids and “sexy robots” feature what at first glance appear to be utopic visions of the future female, now retro when set against 21st century New York. <BR>In another series of women adorned in draping kimonos under phallic trees with Japanese script scrolled down the side, Sorayama creates images of 17th century Kyoto courtesans with Anglo-Saxon features, providing us with a historical lineage for desire in the East. The Western counterpart takes the form of traditional pin-ups, seducing the gaze of the viewer. Finally, Sorayama’s notoriously naughty ladies of the boudoir appear in leather, lace, silk ribbons, and metal chains, eyes firmly fixed on their audience.</p>

<p>DAMIEN HIRST - FORGOTTEN PROMISES</p>

<p>In recent years, Hirst has developed his familiar iconography – the skull, the diamond and the butterfly – to explore fundamental ideas about existence. His work highlights the duality that lies at the heart of human experience, from our inexorable struggles between life and death, beauty and decay, desire and fear, love and loss.<br>
The exhibition also includes a series of brilliant diamond cabinets. Forgotten Sorrows, Lost Friends, and Tears of Joy (all 2010) seem optimistic, yet their titles suggest more contemplative notions of memory, melancholy, and loss. A group of paintings (2008-2009) including Age of Magnificence and Fading Magnificence have real butterflies entombed in layers of shiny metallic paint.</p>

<p>BRETT AMORY - INTENTIONAL ABSTRACTIONS</p>

<p>Intentional Abstractions marks the artist’s first solo show in the UK.<br>A selection of Amory’s work depicts the urban individual's yearning for presence and the seeming
impossibility of attaining it. The paintings portray commuters in transit immersed in a quiet, even hopeful
state or alternately plagued by the anguish of unfulfilled anticipation.
Initially begun in 2001, the series focused on travelers waiting underground on subway platforms.<br> As the
series progressed, the subject ceased to be exclusively travelers with the emphasis shifting to
anonymous figures snapped in the city streets. Although the experience of waiting remains, the
perception has been transformed from a simple, mundane task to one of transcendence.</p>

<p>SERGEJ JENSEN</p>

<p>The first solo exhibition of the Berlin-based artist at a New York museum.<br>
Jensen's poetic artworks provide a fresh approach to Minimalist painting. Employing a wide range of textiles, the artist uses additive and subtractive physical methods like bleaching, fraying, or sewing to stand in for the traditional gestures of pure painting. Through these processes, Jensen creates fragile and quiet abstractions that become contemplations of the history and reuse of his chosen materials, and conjure a network of visual and visceral associations from the stains, holes, cracks, and other traces of use that in turn become his primary pictorial elements.</p>

<p>EXIT X KRINK X ABSOLUT - 1 OF 3</p>

<p>ABSOLUT Vodka unveils ‘A work in Progress’ with internationally renowned New York artist, Krink and Exit Magazine.</p>

<p>With the bottle as his inspiration, Krink has created fifteen individual custom-designed ABSOLUT LIMITED EDITION bottles, with each 70cl bottle being uniquely customized using the artist’s signature; KRINK ink, in striking black, silver and white.</p>

<p>Stephen Toner, Editor of Exit Magazine said, “Exit’s relationship with Absolut spans the past decade. Both share a unique vision of imaginative partnerships with artists and groundbreaking projects. This Autumn/Winter issue we commissioned one of Exit’s favourite street artists, Krink, to bring his creative ideas to life and make the present exceptional with his own interpretation of the ABSOLUT LIMITED EDITION bottle.”</p>

<p>Krink commented, “The shape of the Absolut bottle is a design classic; I wanted to treat it as a sculpture. The bottle shape is iconic enough to represent their brand without showing their logo. The interaction between the drips and the bottle bring two iconic elements together, one helping the other.”</p>

<p>WRECK THE WALLS</p>

<p>Wreck the Walls includes works by over 30 artists, established and emerging, who have helped shape the artistic spirit influenced by their times. Rebellious pioneers of their artistic genres, who come from a background where there are few rules and anything is possible, have helped pave the way for a younger generation of artists who are influenced by their prevailing subculture.<br> From gallery to street art, this show expresses each artist’s divergence and individuality, offering a visual cornucopia of painting, photography, mixed media, works on paper, digital prints, sculpture, graphic design, and illustration.</p>

<p>This show seeks to allow the viewer a window into the myriad worlds of a group of artists whose careers span over two cultural generations, and whose individual visions create a disjointed mosaic. Their works recall the vastly differing self-perceptions cultivated in a patchwork art world constantly seeking to define and redefine itself. Wreck the Walls embraces the multiple identities of the artistic practice, and rather than seeking to congeal the complex layers of artistic vision that make up the culture, the show celebrates distinct perceptions by juxtaposing artists, whether established or emerging, who reject uniformity in a culture that defies singular classification.</p>

<p>MARINA ABRAMOVIĆ : BACK TO SIMPLICITY</p>

<p>Abramovic has contributed in a fundamental manner for the consolidation of performance as a form or artistic expression, in the course of the three decades of her career. Since the 1970’s, Marina Abramovic’s work has explored and tested, by means of countless performances, the human limits, both physical and mental. In Brazil, the artist has participated in the São Paulo Biennales of 1981, 1985 and 2008; the Mercosul Binennale, in 2005; the exhibition Balkan Erotic Epic, carried out at SESC-SP in 2006, curated by Adelina von Fürstenberg; and the solo show Transitory Object for Human Use, carried out at the Galeria Brito Cimino (presently Luciana Brito Galeria), in 2008.
Besides a set of historical artworks, including videos and photographs that document performances the artist has presented since the 1970s, Abramovic will show works from the series “The Kitchen”(2009) and “Back to Simplicity” (2010).</p>

<p>PETER SAUL : FIFTY YEARS OF PAINTING</p>

<p>Twenty important paintings from the span of American painter, Peter Sauls career will be exhibited alongside a selection of new works made especially for the exhibition. Early sketchbooks and a collection of the artist's correspondences and personal artifacts will also be exhibited.</p>

<p>Saul is best known for his paintings depicting exaggerated, provocative images of pop culture ranging from well-known art references to political icons. Saul distorts his figures in order to draw attention to and critique contemporary culture. His paintings are politically charged and sardonically respond to past and current historical events. While working in the early 1960s, Saul's inclusion of bright colors and everyday subjects positioned him as a predecessor of the Pop Art movement.</p>

<p>PHILIPPE PARRENO</p>

<p>Parreno’s exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery has been conceived as a scripted space in which a series of events unfolds. The visitor is guided through the galleries by the orchestration of sound and image, which heightens their sensory experience. Noise from Kensington Gardens and from the surrounding streets can be heard inside the Gallery, as though the outside is leaking in. The blinds come up to reveal a sudden change of weather. Taking the exhibition as a medium, Parreno has sought to redefine the exhibition experience by exploring its possibilities as a coherent ‘object’ rather than a collection of individual works.</p>

<p>The show features the UK premiere of Parreno’s latest film, Invisibleboy (2010), the story of an illegal Chinese immigrant boy who sees imaginary monsters that are scratched onto the film stock.</p>

<p>RICHARD HAMBLETON</p>

<p>Richard Hambleton rose to fame in the early 1980’s when like his contemporaries, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring, he used the streets of New York, San Francisco, Berlin, Paris, London and Japan as his canvas for visually arresting public art, most notably his “Shadowman” and “Crime Scene” series. Where he painted “chalk” outlines around volunteer victims, then splashed red paint on the outline. <br>Hambleton has now been labelled ‘The Godfather of Street Art’, influencing artists such as Paris based street artist Blek le Rat and English street artist Banksy. Of the 45 pieces, 30 works (including 25 never before seen works) will be for sale.</p>

<p>ERICA IL CANE - WE WERE LIVING IN THE WOODS</p>

<p>Erica il Cane (translating to “Eric the Dog”) has gained international recognition for his anthropomorphic  building-sized animal murals throughout Italy and the continent. Erica’s large-scale murals have been transferred from the wall to feature works on paper and a on-site installation.</p>

<p>Born and studied in Bologna, Italy, Erica’s evolution to gallery work has seen depictions of animals in unique, human situations rendered in Victorian-like style illustrations, etchings, and short animated films. The art is often described as imagery from a dark fairy tale, in which animals are shown within the darkness of human nature, focusing on themes of alienation, satire and existentialism.</p>

<p>RAYMOND PETTIBON - HARD IN THE PAINT</p>

<p>This exhibition takes its title from basketball terminology: used to describe
a player moving within the rectangular and usually painted area below
the net, “hard in the paint” indicates the difficulty in scoring from this
angle amidst defensive pressure. In slang, it is also used to denote a
confident, tough, or aggressive disposition, and as such, it is reflective of the directness of Pettibon’s work. Hard in the Paint presents a wide range of drawings unified by their bold, vivid lines and striking compositions. <BR>
Fragments from American society have been singled out and distilled to key images, which often incorporate texts of varying
length from one word to several paragraphs. The selection of texts, which over the course of Pettibon’s career have come to
span a broad array of influences from popular media to Marcel Proust, William Faulkner, Henry James, Gustave Flaubert, and
the Bible, relate both rhythmically and narratively to the visual content of his drawings, although their relationship may not
always be immediately apparent.</p>

<p>RONZO PRESENTS : CRACKNEY'S FINEST</p>

<p>Ronzo's second solo exhibition features a new series of paintings, collages, prints and sculptures showing life in the 'Ronzo Borough of Crackney'. It is a dark but funny place inspired by the experience of living in London's East End borough of Hackney. Ronzo's vision of Crackney is crawling with surreal characters including crack smoking squirrels and a pizza delivering giant cock roach.</p>

<p>PAUL THEK : DIVER, A RETROSPECTIVE</p>

<p>Paul Thek: Diver, a Retrospective is the first retrospective in the United States devoted to the legendary American artist Paul Thek (1933-1988). A sculptor, painter, and one of the first artists to create environments or installations, Thek came to recognition showing his sculpture in New York galleries in the 1960s. The first works exhibited, which he began making in 1964 and called “meat pieces” as they were meant to resemble flesh, were encased in Plexiglas boxes that recall Minimal sculptures. <br>At the end of the sixties, Thek left for Europe, where he created extraordinary environments, incorporating elements from art, literature, theater, and religion, often employing fragile and ephemeral substances, including wax and latex.</p>

<p>PETER ALEXANDER + SARAH BRAMAN</p>

<p>These two seemingly disparate artists coalesce in this show of sculpture and wall-mounted objects. The idea for this exhibition originated at NADA 2009 where Sarah Braman viewed Peter Alexander’s work for the first time. Her initial reaction and Alexander’s subsequent response to Braman’s work led to enthusiastic plans for this show.</p>

<p>Though Alexander and Braman are from opposite coasts and different generations, their works balance sinuously and occupy space with a shared sensitivity to situation and context. Each artist addresses concerns of perception, light, atmosphere, and spatial orientation, employing color and translucence and resolving their own formal pursuits in ways that are varied yet surprisingly compatible. In doing so, their work becomes a concrete, abstract response to a personal and atmospheric experience.</p>

<p>SLATER BRADLEY AND ED LACHMAN - SHADOW</p>

<p>A new video work by Slater Bradley in collaboration with Academy Award–nominated cinematographer Ed Lachman, takes as its inspiration the unfinished Hollywood film Dark Blood (1993), which was never completed due to the untimely death of its star, River Phoenix. Seventeen years later, Shadow presents a kind of prologue to the original film, revisiting Phoenix’s character (here, by Ben Brock) while creating a new narrative which, when woven together with the original, creates a labyrinthine tale that blurs the lines between illusion and reality.</p>

<p>POUL GERNES</p>

<p>For the first time this exhibition provides Gernes’ extensive and intensively colored painterly abstractions in a setting commensurate with their spatial dimensions. In the Deichtorhallen it is possible to present his unusually large-format work series in a spacious museum architecture with 3000 square meters. In this way, the monumental scale of Gernes’ pieces that oscillates between abstraction and ornamental design becomes appropriately tangible as an objective of his art.</p>

<p>This exhibition sheds clear light on the important stages in Gernes’ development – from virtually unknown studies from the 1940s to the large-format stylized floral and linear forms that featured in his late flower paintings of the 1990s. Over 400 exhibits provide a comprehensive insight into the art of the Danish painter, sculptor, filmmaker and performing artist Poul Gernes.</p>

Referencing popular childhood characters he asks the viewer to question the agenda of media that is subjected to us, involuntarily sculpting our values and opinions. ‘Blind by Stardom’ is a comment on society being conditioned to worship fame and celebrity status as a way to keep the masses occupied so to keep them from questioning anything.</p>

For more than five decades Carlos Cruz-Diez has intensively experimented with the origins and optics of color.

<p>TODD JAMES - GREAT ADVENTURE</p>

<p>In Great Adventure Todd James depicts subjects as varied as modern day Somali pirates, anthropomorphized war machines of every type, his signature women in emotionally barren landscapes, and irreverent portraits of the personnel that Western governments, with straight faces, call “peacekeeing forces.” <br>The raw transgressive lines of these daunting compositions are rendered in a bright palette of colours that lends the work an innocent and disarming appearance, but deeper exploration shows that despite this cheery surface, the artist is dealing in themes of warfare and global conflict, damage and desperation; subjects whose reality must be sublimated to be bearable, and which here are triangulated effortlessly, astonishingly, and somehow, with James’ trademark humor.</p>

<p>Todd James says simply: “The reason I find things like this funny is because sometimes you need to laugh to keep from crying”. With this new collection of paintings, which includes some of the artist’s first works in oil, viewers may find both reactions conflictingly appropriate.</p>

<p>THE SHADES - JEFFREY GIBSON AND JACKIE SACCOCCIO</p>

<p>The Shades by Jackie Saccoccio &amp; Jeffrey Gibson, is the 1st time both artists are exhibiting together. Each artist uses their own dense visual language as muse and expands on it using subjective and improvisational strategies countered by more objective and decisive structuring of the overall gallery installation, accessing The Shades.<br> The title lightly refers to Ovid's Rome where the ghosts of the ancient Romans are referred to as shades of the dead, their physical description being immense and shapeless. Saccoccio and Gibson take this as a metaphorical starting point to consider contemporary abstraction. The works traverse the real and are fixed on the viewing moment. The paintings are real and of this world. Both artists take what is happening within the paintings to address the space, alter the space, re-inven t a space. Ab-Ex, Pattern &amp; Decoration, Neo Geo and Op mix with Dadaist and Conceptual practises.</p>

<p>Into Darkness will feature Neck Face at his nastiest - meaning of course, at his best. Following up 2009's now legendary performance-cum-exhibition in Miami, the artist sets his sights on Hollywood and brings with him the same energy and originality that has made him a cult favorite. Lock your windows and close your doors. He's on the loose and there's no telling what surprises he'll have in store this Halloween.</p>

<p>Neck Face is an artist who manages to imbue humor into violence, locate amusement in fear, and takes pleasure in rattling nerves. His work is simultaneously sinister and grim, genuine and playful. He toys with the sacrilegious, antagonizes phobias, and triggers insecurities, all with a measure of ambivalence. His distinctive style straddles the line between reckless and deliberate, yet the work maintains a sense of immediacy, and is always provocative.</p>

<p>CHRISTIAN LEMMERZ - HYPNOSIS</p>

<p>For his first solo exhibition in China, the German-born sculptor Christian Lemmerz has created a large installation entitled Hypnosis, which seeks to confront us directly with our own life – and not least our own death.</p>

<p>Christian Lemmerz always engages with the major conditions of our existence in his art – life, death, love, religion, freedom, oppression – and his works are usually executed such that they try to stimulate a reaction from or a relationship with the viewer. Art should function as a provocative confrontation, thinks Christian Lemmerz.</p>

<p>In a grid from the ceiling hang hundreds of skulls in front of which the viewer can stand – one viewer to each skull. The skulls revolve and function as a fixation for the eye, while a hypnosis-inducing voice speaks slowly and penetratingly into the space and urges us to think about our lives – and about the inevitability of death, about death as a release. The question is of course whether the viewer dares to remain standing through-out the countdown from ten to zero</p>

<p>STANLEY DONWOOD - OVER NORMAL</p>

<p>Over Normal is the first ever solo exhibition by Stanley Donwood in the United States. The catalyst for the large works featured in the show is in Los Angeles, where Stanley began to notice (with equal parts amazement and distress) that the advertisements bombarding him on the multilane highways were made of seven basic colors, immediately grabbing viewers’ attention in a primal way.  <br>More recently, Stanley noticed a parallel between the use of those colors and an influx of spam emails that promised everything from more fruitful sex lives, to cheap foreclosed properties at the expense of someone else’s misery. <br>The word’s that were used in the emails were formatted in the same fundamental way as color in the advertisement’s had been used: to grab unconscious attention and tell a story without the viewer knowing it.  Marrying the immediate words used in these emails with the attractive and distressing colors of the advertisements, Stanley has produced a line of seven vibrant, original pieces for this exhibition.</p>

<p>BARRY MCGEE - HOUSTON STREET MURAL</p>

<p>Barry McGee  took to the wall made famous by Keith Haring in the 1980s by covering the entire canvas with red spray-painted tags — a simple follow-up to Fairey’s politically charged piece, which blended pop art and social commentary.</p>

<p>McGee created “the ultimate graffiti writer’s roll call” by painting the names of well-known taggers across the massive wall, producing “a strangely beautiful, if not challenging piece of commissioned abstract art,”</p>

<p>BIG BAMBU AT THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART</p>

<p>Invited by The Metropolitan Museum of Art to create a site-specific installation for The Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden, the twin brothers Mike and Doug Starn  present their new work, Big Bambu: You Can't, You Don't, and You Won't Stop. <br>The monumental bamboo structure, ultimately measuring 100 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 50 feet high, takes the form of a cresting wave that bridges realms of sculpture, architecture, and performance. Visitors witness the continuing creation and evolving incarnations of Big Bambú as it is constructed throughout the spring, summer, and fall by the artists and a team of rock climbers. Set against Central Park and its urban backdrop, Big Bambu suggests the complexity and energy of an ever-changing living organism.<br>It is the thirteenth-consecutive single-artist installation on the Roof Garden.</p>

<p>DAMIEN HIRST - THE SOULS</p>

<p>Hirst has filled the Paul Stolper Gallery with 120 framed, foilblock butterfly prints.
In total ‘The Souls’ is made up of 4 butterflies, in 80 different colourways, each one in an edition of 15.</p>

<p>Hirst’s fascination with butterflies derives in large part from the way in which these beautiful insects
embody both the beauty and the impermanence of life, becoming symbols of faith and mortality. Of ‘The Souls’ he has said: “I love butterflies because when they are dead they look alive. The foilblock
makes the butterflies have a feel similar to the actual butterflies in the way that they reflect the light.</p>

<p>SPECTER</p>

<p>Brooklyn-based street artist Specter makes his UK debut this month.
He creates installations and street artwork displayed in abandoned buildings and forgotten spaces to draw attention to the urban situation which is the inspiration for his creative concepts.<br>
He evolves the subject matter by interlacing influences from the environment he chooses to adorn, incorporating characteristics from the surrounding neighbourhoods, architecture, local business and social economic classes; transforming the unwitting publics’ understanding of the space.<br>
Through graffiti influence, he became obsessed with art in public spaces, where he sees potential inspiration and appropriate location to express his creativity. His aim is to deconstruct preconceived perceptions and draw attention to the neglected and less desirable issues, the non-sensational stories of the undervalued detritus of our culture we seldom hear about.</p>

<p>RICHARD PRINCE - T-SHIRT PAINTINGS: HIPPIE PUNK</p>

<p>Casually stretched, messily painted, and intimate in scale, the T-shirt paintings both mirror Prince’s more known work and co-exist alongside it, exploring other avenues of the artist’s persona. The T-shirt paintings vary in theme and style: some contain iconic Richard Prince jokes; some exploit Prince’s interest in hippie and rock and roll subcultures; others are abstract. A handful of childlike animal and flower drawings that normally hang in Prince’s daughter’s bedroom appear together with T-shirts adorned with Jimi Hendrix and the CD labels from his collection of Led Zeppelin albums.</p>

<p>BEN WEINER - MATERIAL AND ILLUSION</p>

<p>Ben Weiner's second solo exhibition in Los Angeles. For the first time in the artist's career, he includes four stop-motion video works in addition to five studio-fresh oil paintings rendered in his signature photorealistic technique.</p>

<p>Through cropped magnifications, Weiner decontextualizes the commonplace to achieve conceptually transcendent and enigmatic abstractions. In his most recent body of work, the artist continues to resolve mass production with artistic creation by referencing Clement Greenberg's formalist notion of art exploring the nature of medium. Weiner's portrayals of synthetic materials such as high-fructose corn syrup, beauty products, and oil paint, achieve arresting duality through their vague familiarity and simultaneous mystique, reflecting our zeitgeist's fascination with artifice and imitation. In conversation with Weiner's transformative videos, his paintings confront our societal resistance to mortality and the unrefined.</p>

<p>RODNEY DICKSON - PAINTINGS</p>

<p>Rodney Dickson is a great force in painting. He is his own man and works without compromise, disregarding passing fashion or style. Often shocking, he challenges our aesthetic values beyond good taste, digging to explore the deeper impulses of our psychology. He draws together disparate ways of working, changing from realistic to abstract, using thick or thin paint and applying it with his hands when necessary, or a brush, pouring or spraying, constantly searching for the clearest expression. "Since my time as a student I have never considered good painting to be limited to one style. Instead we must use anything to drag a painting out of ourselves".</p>

<p>In all of his paintings there are layers of previous paintings, traces of imagery, mostly now obscured. The result of this ruthless practice of constantly creating and destroying is to put life and history into the work. Some of the imagery may in the end be unseen, and here the artist notes a parallel to how our individual personalities are formed by the accumulation of often unnoticed life events. He sees his work as an exploration of the human condition. His working practice is relentless, striving daily to paint better than before in the belief that each new painting will bring him closer to his goal.</p>

<p>MARKUS LINNENBRINK</p>

<p>Markus Linnenbrink known internationally for his brightly
colored resin paintings and sculptures, in this show, Nomatterwhereyougothereyouare,
he creates an installation that covers the walls, ceiling
and floor of the gallery.<br>
Whether employing traditional supports, building sculptures, or
engaging directly with the space itself, present always is the
joy Linnenbrink has in creating his works. His "drip" paintings
literally ooze shiny colors which then extend from the surface
edge. With his "drilled" paintings, he builds layers of colored
resin before he excavates his composition, revealing each
multicolored surface in a concentric circle that either floats or
interacts with the other marks on the support.<br>
For this exhibition, Linnenbrink will create a single painting
that will span the entire gallery, beginning somewhere on the
walls and extending to the ceiling and floor, folding in on
itself in various diagonals, until the beginning reunites with
the end.</p>

<p>BUDDY NESTOR - EVERY GIRL GOES TO HELL</p>

<p>Buddy Nestor began his career in paint in 1997. He’d recently had a son and decided to teach himself. In 1999, he traveled the world on an aircraft carrier. This allowed plenty of time to paint, and solidified Nestor’s interest in art and painting. When he arrived back home, he pursued a BFA in painting.
“Every Girl Goes to Hell” is Nestor’s latest body of work. He takes beautiful models and makes them ugly. The series is on show early April through the remainder of the month.</p>

<p>REY ORTEGA "THE LAND" AND ROB CORLESS "OFFERINGS"</p>

<p>All three artists take us on a fantastic journey of storytelling, imagination, and discovery. Rey Ortega’s The Land is about a fictional people and place of his own design explored through an outsider’s point of view. He examines the land, its people, their architecture, objects, and culture of this made-up world.<br>Rob Corless’ Offerings marries his daily reality with a surreal world that beats about in his head.  He takes familiar images and positioned them where only the truly imaginative can tread. And Julian Callos’ Into the Unknown leaves the familiar behind and explores uncharted territory, while discovering one’s self in the process.</p>

<p>HENRIK VIBSKOV GRAPHIC WORKS</p>

<p>Some might call Henrik Vibskov a jack-of-all-trades, and it is true that Vibskov shows his innovative fashion designs in Paris, exhibits his artwork at established institutions such as PS1, MoMA, the Palais de Tokio and MU, and makes musical collaborations with the likes of Anders Trentemøller and Mikael Simpson. However for Vibskov, these seemingly different creative realms are not separate – it is intrinsic to his philosophy that they blend together, resulting in an all-inclusive Henrik Vibskov experience.</p>

<p>In Henrik Vibskov: Graphic Works, Vibskov presents a selection of his two-dimensional pieces, exhibited alongside installation and knit-works. With colorful and organic shapes that seem like strange, animated beings, Vibskov’s minimalistic “form-language” and “anarchistic lines” offer a glimpse at his own imagined universe.</p>

<p>THE REFLECTED GAZE</p>

<p>Following the first known self-portrait by Jan van Eyck, in 1433, to Durer’s self promotional works and the haunting self-portraits of Rembrandt, art history has since been full of the subjective gaze of the artist upon themselves.<br> Today the practice continues, often for very widely differing conceptual reasons, but the telling self study still hints at mortality as well as exploring that strange meeting point where the introspective self gaze meets the objective outward look and attunes itself in order to displace the subjective/objective dichotomy.</p>

<p>ANDY BURGESS - GET WHAT YOU WANT</p>

<p>Get What You Want will be the first one-man exhibition in the United States for Andy Burgess. The exhibition will focus on jazzy
paintings and the small-scale collages they are fueled by. Burgess is a Tucson and London based artist who is an avid collector
of graphic ephemera from the “golden age” of American graphic design.<BR>
Andy Burgess embraces the notion of nostalgia in all he creates. His influences are varied, yet Burgess brings them together
seamlessly – the freedom and experimentation of the American beat poets and pop artists getting harnessed by the hard line
geometries and color theories of early constructivist and Bauhaus artists and thinkers. Get What You Want is the fabric of
everyday Americana channeled through long standing European traditions. The resulting works are truly timeless.</p>

<p>MARTHA COOPER STREET SHOTS</p>

<p>Martha Cooper has been photographing creative kids in action on city streets since the mid-1970s. In Street Shots, opening January 16th at Subliminal Projects, her photos reveal the imaginative children of pre-renewal New York City as they mined the abandoned lots of the city to create toys from trash. Cooper, renowned for her graffiti and hip-hop pictures, brings those classic images together with ones depicting inner-city kids building forts from scrap, catching flies in cola bottles and racing homemade go-karts—all without adult supervision.</p>

<p>The opening of Street Shots also marks several debuts: Cooper’s new book, Going Postal, a collection of photos of postal labels bearing street art; her image collaboration with Shepard Fairey, available as a screen-print poster; and her own Obey line, with photos printed on clothing, bags, and skateboards. All will be available for purchase at Subliminal Projects, along with Cooper’s other books, including Subway Art, Hip Hop Files, Street Play, We B*Girlz and Tag Town.</p>

<p>BAUHAUS</p>

<p>This survey is MoMA’s first major exhibition since 1938 on the subject of this famous and influential school of avant-garde art. Founded in 1919 and shut down by the Nazis in 1933, the Bauhaus brought together artists, architects, and designers in an extraordinary conversation about the nature of art in the age of technology. <br>Aiming to rethink the very form of modern life, the Bauhaus became the site of a dazzling array of experiments in the visual arts that have profoundly shaped our visual world today</p>

<p>POP LIFE</p>

<p>Pop Life: Art in a Material Worldproposes a re-reading of one of the major legacies of Pop Art.

<p>HEAVEN</p>

<p>Honor Fraser is pleased to present an exhibition of new works by Tomoo Gokita. In past works Tomoo Gokita has drawn and painted from budget pornography, selectively rendering and partially obscuring - with his signature abstractions - the awkward posture of staged pleasure. <br> While there is nothing awkward or contrived about the paintings, what they do have in common with pornography of any kind is their ability to provoke an intense emotional reaction from the viewer.</p>

<p>CLOUDED APOLLO</p>

<p>In her paintings Chloe Early creates a fantastical landscape, an urban utopia where strange and wonderful things happen. For this exhibition 'Clouded Apollo', she has referenced a variety of images and contexts; a female figure twists and turns through time, suspended in an interior world of opulence and beauty, echos of patterns and pillars, glass roofs, chandeliers and roses. Outside we see far away skylines, buildings rising and falling, destruction and the prescient image of destruction; a tank.</p>

<p>Lazarides is proud to announce that Antony Micallef's solo show 'Becoming Animal'. The paintings, drawings and collages in the show are built upon a profound belief in the act of painting and mark making. This show comes as the result of a personal period of self examination, exploring the experiences of an artist in London through the sensations of light and dark mirrored in both his palette and his choice of imagery. 'Becoming Animal' is Antony's first UK solo show in three years and certainly won't fail to impress both old fans and viewers new to his work.</p>

<p>INVADER TOP 10</p>

<p>Jonathan LeVine Gallery is pleased to present Top 10, a solo exhibition of new works by the Parisian street artist known as Invader.<br> Returning to the gallery for his first solo show in New York, Top 10 marks a highly anticipated event for this internationally celebrated artist. Known for using mosaic tiles to re-create popular characters from vintage 8-bit video games (such as Space Invaders and Pac-Man) on the streets of cities around the world, the artist’s individual mosaics are carefully cataloged after placement in context to their surrounding environment. Yet, since the project has grown on a global-scale, each piece also carries considerable significance from a larger perspective - populating what is now a worldwide installation that stretches across the planet. Invader’s mosaics can be found on the streets of over 40 cities, on all five (inhabitable) continents. Like the game, his mission is literally an invasion of (public) space.</p>

<p>Exhibition runs through to July 25th, 2009</p>

Throughout the summer, visitors will find some unusual specimens amongst the museum's permanent collection -  a stonehenge made from portable toilets greets visitors on arrival, a burnt out ice cream van now replaces the enquiries desk and the life size historic biplane suspended from the ceiling now provides refuge for a Guantanamo bay escapee.

<p>THE DAN FLAVIN ART INSTITUTE</p>

<p>Established in 1983 as a permanent installation of Flavin’s work, this renovated firehouse holds a permanent installation of nine works in fluorescent light created by the artist between 1963 and 1981. The permanent installation traces Flavin’s practice from 1963—when he decided to work solely with standard fluorescent fixtures and tubes—to 1983, when the presentation was realized. In creating this exhibition, Flavin conceived of the sculptures and the architecture as a single, unified installation. By manipulating the formal, phenomenal, and referential characteristics of light, the installation asks viewers to consider a series of contrasts—between colors, intensities of light, structure and formlessness, the obvious and the mysterious, and the serious and the humorous</p>

<p>The Dan Flavin Art Institute is open Thursday through Sunday, 12pm to 6pm. Admission is free. Corwith Avenue off Main Street, Bridgehampton, NY.</p>

<p>SELF PORTRAITS</p>

<p>The idea of this exhibition is to approach the historical theme of self-portraits and to bring it into a contemporary art context. A self-portrait is a representation of an artist, drawn, painted, photographed, or sculpted by the artist. Although self-portraits have been made by artists since the earliest times, it is not until the Early Renaissance in the mid 1400s that artists can be frequently identified depicting themselves as either the main subject, or as important characters in their work. With better and cheaper mirrors, and the advent of the panel portrait, many painters, sculptors and printmakers tried some form of self-portraiture… In this respect it will be an interesting and new experience to show the vision of the “self-portrait” by contemporary urban artists from all over the world.</p>

<p>THOSE WHO SUFFER LOVE</p>

<p>White Cube Mason's Yard is pleased to announce an exhibition of new work by Tracey Emin, one of Britain's most influential artists. 'Those who suffer Love' is her first exhibition in London for four years and her fourth with the gallery. "The title for my show is self-explanatory: love rarely comes easily and if it does, it usually goes quite quickly. And there is death, and loss, which at some point in our lives we all have to deal with. I'm constantly fighting with the notion of love and passion. Love, sex, lust - in my heart and mind there is always some battle, some kind of conflict. This show is essentially a drawings show. Everything is simple and linear, straight to the point. The show is to coincide with the release of my book 'One Thousand Drawings' published by Rizzoli.</p>

<p>WRAP UP</p>

<p>Louis Vuitton’s association with art is a long story. For over 150 years, the House synonymous with French elegance and style has been working with the best engineers, decorators and artists. Under the impetus of Marc Jacobs, artistic director since 1997, Louis Vuitton has been revitalized and new collaborations with artists such as Stephen Sprouse, Takashi Murakami and Richard Prince have proved the brand’s commitment to push the dialogue between luxury and modern art even further.</p>

<p>Organized by the Hong Kong Museum of Art and in collaboration with the Consulate General of France in Hong Kong and Macau, “Louis Vuitton: A Passion for Creation” poises to be one of the star attractions of the 17th French May Arts Festival. This exhibition showcases Louis Vuitton’s long history and association with the world of art, as well as its passion in working with different artists in various ways.</p>

<p>Open to public from May 22nd to August 9th 2009, “Louis Vuitton: A Passion for Creation” is composed of three parts, each of which deals with different aspects of the House’s activities and projects in the artistic domain.</p>

<p>To celebrate this spectacular event, the façade of the Hong Kong Museum of Art will be wrapped up with the “After Dark” series of Richard Prince, presenting a new landscape of art to the panoramic Victoria Harbour of Hong Kong. The “After Dark” series features Hong Kong and other cities across the globe. This also is one of the first public art installations in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Museum of Art has always taken an open minded approach towards the display of contemporary artwork, one characteristic of contemporary art is controversial representation of creativity.</p>

<p>This exhibition runs from May 18th to August 9th, 2009</p>

<p>STORM DRAINS</p>

<p>The 6emeia project was created and developed by the artists Anderson Augusto, also known as SÃO, and Leonardo Delafuente, also known as Delafuente. The duo live in the Barra Funda neighborhood of São Paulo where they began the project with the purpose of changing and transforming daily life.</p>

<p>The duo's objective is to modify the means within which we all live, proposing a new way to view things by reflecting upon themes generated through creative and unusual works. Such modifications are made by painting storm drains, light posts, manhole covers and any other object which makes up the urban scenario.</p>

<p>With the painted storm drains, a new type of communication is proposed between art and the city as well as between art and the residents. Art then becomes within the reach and at the service of everyone. By looking with care at the most forgotten and indifferent objects, one can take in art in a new way. The painted storm drains are like colorful drops falling into animmense ash-colored canvass</p>

<p>LAZARUS RISING</p>

<p>In his first solo show at the Elms Lesters Painting Rooms, the world renowned painter Ron English, father of the Agit Pop Movement, pays homage to Picasso's GUERNICA. Ron English presents some of his latest canvases from a series of paintings based on the 1937 masterpiece, which depicted the tragedy of the Spanish Civil war, transcribing it to reflect our troubled times, alongside an extraordinary body of new works. In the show, entitled Lazarus Rising, the theme of resurrection is deliberately provocative and reflects the contemporary socio-political situation, presenting uncomfortable and dark insights beneath the slick, plastic face of our society.</p>

<p>SILENT ECHOES</p>

<p>'Silent Echoes', a new audio and video work by Bill Fontana, explores the sounds of five famous Buddhist Temple bells in Kyoto when they are not ringing. Vibration sensors were attached to the bells and acoustic microphones were placed inside of their resonant cavities. They measured and recorded how these bells are in fact ringing all the time in response to the ambient sounds of the environment. In the context and psychology of Buddhist culture the idea of a bell ringing all the time is a powerful metaphor. There is a famous mediation in which one strikes a bowl shaped bell and if one's attention is unwavering one experiences that this bell does not stop ringing as long one is listening.</p>

<p>McGEE, TEMPLETON, PETTIBON</p>

<p>Barry McGee, Ed Templeton and Raymond Pettibon are pioneers and icons of the contemporary urban art movement. Their work can be found in the collections of major museums and has been shown at large exhibitions and biennales worldwide, but all three have repeatedly emphasised their roots in youth subculture – in the worlds of skateboarding, graffiti, punk and hip-hop. They are joined by an overriding interest in portraying the underdogs, outcasts and anti-heroes of society. Curator Aaron Rose, whose urban art documentary Beautiful Losers is currently touring the world to enthusiastic reviews, is showing these three sought-after artists in the intimate atmosphere of a Berlin gallery. The direct proximity of their works not only allows us to draw interesting conclusions about each artist’s style, but also underscores their unique similarities.</p>

The building, entirely covered with a smooth elastic membrane, will be flipped using cranes, completely reconfiguring the visitor's experience with each new programme. Each side plan is precisely designed to organize a different event installation creating a building with four identities.

<p>COLLAGE GEOMANCY</p>

<p>Marlborough Chelsea are curently exhibiting a series of recent collages by New York based artist Michael Anderson. 
This will be the artist’s third solo exhibition with Marlborough and his second at Marlborough Chelsea. The exhibition will consist of twelve new collages and a single sculpture, all of which are comprised of mass-produced advertising materials accumulated by the artist. <br>
Born in the Bronx in 1968, Mr. Anderson began his artistic career fusing painting and collage but has concentrated on collage since the early 1990s. Since that time his materials have consisted solely of posters and billboards found on the streets of international cities and physically torn down by the artist. In each work, multiple copies of the same advertisement are ripped into hundreds of varying pieces and reassembled into dynamic compositions that reflect the artist’s simultaneous commitments to representation and abstraction. The effect is one of vague recognition by the viewer, who has undoubtedly passed several of the images while walking down the streets of New York, Beijing or Rome, without stopping to focus on their cultural significance or aesthetic properties.</p>

<p>DONKEY HOSTAGE</p>

<p>Boy meets girl, girl ties boy to donkey…</p>

<p>A major new collection of distinctive drawings and paintings by Kirsty Whiten depict intimate struggles as boys are taken hostage, cared for, teased and broken in like horses.</p>

<p>They play and fight in costumes constructed from materials found in their homes; weapons from the kitchen, riding gear from adidas, hair -pieces, scarves and turbans made from towels and t shirts. Adults using childlike play to act out the best and worst of their dependency and desire.
The fierce and delicate images explore sexuality, control and truce, the tenderness of surrender - the roles fought over and claimed by modern men and women.</p>

<p>MMM - 20 YEARS</p>

<p>Following his studies at the Antwerp Academy and his work as an assistant to Jean-Paul Gaultier, the Belgian Martin Margiela founded Maison Martin Margiela in 1988. The firm's 20th anniversary is the reason for this exhibition. Maison Martin Margiela is based in Paris and designs fashion that rebels against the industry's constraints while also commenting on these.</p>

<p>Maison Martin Margiela's (MMM) approach differs in many ways from what is usual in the fashion trade. Rather than engaging in the personality cult like other fashion houses, MMM functions according to the principal of incognito: In order to focus the attention solely on the company's products, Martin Margiela does not even appear in public at fashion shows and does not publish his portrait. MMM gives interviews in the first person plural either by e-mail or fax. It is unusual and uncompromising to remain incognito in a field in which many fashion designers behave like stars whose personal appearances provide almost as much as an incentive to buy as their creations. At MMM it is not the designer who is in the spotlight but the product.</p>

<p>VB64</p>

<p>Deitch Projects presents VB64, Vanessa Beecroft’s first public performance in New York since 2000 and an accompanying exhibition of new sculpture at Deitch Studios on the East River in Long Island City. The sculptures from the performance along with a video projection of the performance, will be on view through Sunday April 12th. An exhibition of new wax and gesso sculptures will also be on view in the adjoining gallery.</p>

<p>Vanessa Beecroft works in the space between painting, sculpture, performance, and real life. In VB64, she introduces a new element into the work, gesso sculptures cast from live models, resting on coffin-like bases. The twenty live models in the performance will be in white body make up and at the beginning of the performance will be indistinguishable from the sculptural casts. VB64 pushes Beecroft’s deliberate confusion between sculpture, performance and real life into a new realm, the tension between life and death.</p>

<p>RICHTER PORTRAITS</p>

<p>Gerhard Richter Portraits is the first major exhibition to show a selection of Richter's portraits across the entire span of his career. (Opposite Gilbert and George by Gerhard Richter 1975) <br>Dating from the 1960s to the present, it includes important early black-and-white paintings made from magazine photographs, works based on private snapshots, a special installation of his celebrated series 48 Portraits, and a never-previously exhibited portrait of his daughter Ella. 
Richter is widely regarded as one of the world's leading contemporary artists, a complex figure whose work from the early 1960s has moved between photographically derived figurative imagery and brightly coloured abstract painting.</p>

<p>From the outset portraiture has been a key aspect of Richter's art but until now exhibitions of his art have focused on the wider sweep of his activity including his abstract work and, as a result, the richness of his portraits has been neglected. This exhibition represents a major advance in the understanding and appreciation of the artist's achievement by examining his portraits in detail. The exhibition will comprise around 35 key paintings lent from major international public and private collections. Organised chronologically, Gerhard Richter Portraits will also highlight particular themes that focus on the sources of Richter's imagery in order to draw out the artist's principal preoccupations and main lines of development. These themes include The Most Perfect Picture (which focuses on Richter's early use of photographs from newspapers and magazines), Devotional Pictures (which examines his use of amateur photographs from family albums), Persistent Uncertainty, (the exhibition's central section in which the photographic sources of Richter's imagery are progressively obscured and manipulated), Art History, (focusing on images of Richter's associations within the art world), and Private Images, Personal Portraits (in which the artist's preoccupation with his family and his own image take centre stage).</p>

<p>THE LONG WAY HOME</p>

<p>Honor Fraser is pleased to present a solo exhibition of new work by KAWS. (Featured opposite, Kurf (Tangle) 2009, Acrylic on canvas, 72 x 96 inches)</p>

<p>The Brooklyn-based artist will be presenting new painting and sculptural work in his first solo show in Los Angeles. KAWS’ technique acts as a sieve of modern culture, filtering and re-contextualizing the images and information that he comes in contact with daily. His process is all encompassing, embracing popular culture and the visual landscape of the familiar. The work can be thought of as an overarching brand; however it is also immediate and organic. This energetic immediacy can be felt in the selection of works that he is presenting. New large paintings included in the exhibition feature his usual cross-section of familiar cultural icons painted with precise execution. The resulting pieces feature the trademark graphic quality inherent in his work. A large life-size Chum acts as a sentry in the space, watching over the works while also playing with scale and proportion.</p>

<p>KAWS roots began as a graffiti artist in the early 1990s, and since then he has built an identity that had its genesis in guerilla imagery added to billboards and bus shelters. He converts familiar visuals into affronting works of art. Through his company OriginalFake he has released limited edition works. He has also collaborated on design projects with Commes Des Garcons, Marc Jacobs, and A Bathing Ape. Most recently he has worked with Kanye West to create the cover art for Kanye’s current album. <br>This reworking of popular culture has grown KAWS into a multi-faceted, multi-pronged endeavor that has ventured into the realm of contemporary art. KAWS situates himself at the crossroads of media and art; a vanguard in the new frontier of the 21st century artistic discourse.</p>

<p>The exhibition runs until the 4th of April 2009</p>

<p>HYPE, HUSTLE, RIP-OFF</p>

<p>Bill McMullen's work is at the locus of control between contemporary culture's learned helplessness and mass production's planned obsolescence. The seduction of immediate consumption, along with its resulting hand-to-mouth futurism, are analyzed by McMullen as one half civics lesson and one half the jouissance of the advertising age running its ultimate course. The tail-eating snake that hides in this era's economic deluge becomes McMullen's inspirational void from which both political and artistic action springs forth.</p>

<p>Hype, Hustle, Rip-Off is more than just a critical look at the learned obsolescence and planned helplessness of Post-Cold War capitalism. It is a glimpse at the post-pop art world's potential trajectory—beyond the simple needs of political poster simulacra branding, venal location based parochialism, and the corporate shilling that uses a contrived cloak of cosmopolitan surrealism. McMullen's work ultimately resonates because it does more than brand, copy, market, and elevate, since he understands that all of these actions are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>Robotic, sound and solar sculptures, mechanical writing machines, laser and subliminal installations are just some of the incredible exhibits at Kinetica Art Fair, the world’s first art fair dedicated to kinetic, robotic, sound, light and time-based art. Carnivorous art, man-animal-machine hybrids, mechanical drawing machines, subliminal installations, pole dancing robots, light sculptures and cybernetics are just some of the exhibits to be found at Kinetica Art Fair, the UK's first art fair dedicated to kinetic, robotic, sound, light and time based art which opens in London on Friday 27 February.</p>

<p>More than 25 galleries and organisations specialising in kinetic, electronic and new media art are taking part with over 150 exhibiting artists. The Fair will be like no other with living, moving, speaking and performing art. The Fair provides unparalleled opportunities for the public and collectors alike to view and buy work from this thriving international movement and to participate in the programme of talks, workshops and performances. Kinetic art is art that has a life of it's own. Pioneered by world famous artists such as Maholy Nagy, Jean Tinguely, Marcel Duchamp and Alexander Calder during the early 1900s, modern contemporary kinetic and electronic artworks utilise and warp technology itself, to explore, nurture and comment on our evolutionary processes and challenge scientific and universal exploration.</p>

<p>LE CORBUSIER</p>

<p>Le Corbusier - The Art of Architecture at Barbican Art Gallery    is the first major survey 
in London of the internationally renowned architect in more than 20 years. This timely 
reassessment charts how the work of Le Corbusier - a pseudonym of Charles-Édouard 
Jeanneret-Gris - changed dramatically throughout his career. Spanning a period of 60 years 
the exhibition includes early works inspired by his native Switzerland, the iconic white cubic 
buildings of the 1920s such as the famous Villa Savoye (1928-31) and culminating in the late 
works of the 1950s and 60s of which the Chapel of Ronchamp (1950-55) and the buildings for 
the Indian city of Chandigarh (1952-64) are key examples.</p>

<p>The exhibition focuses on Le Corbusier’s unique multi-disciplinary approach, and brings</p>

<p>together a wealth of his paintings, films, sculpture and books alongside vintage photographs, 
original architectural models and interior settings. It also features important works by his 
collaborators and artistic contemporaries such as furniture designers Charlotte Perriand and 
Jean Prouvé, and artists Fernand Léger and Amédée Ozenfant.</p>

<p>The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao will present ©MURAKAMI, the most comprehensive retrospective to date of the works of Takashi Murakami. The exhibition will feature more than 90 artworks in various media including painting, sculpture, installation, and film. Included will be iconic works that track the ongoing evolution of Murakami's anime alter ego DOB, his otaku-inspired figure projects of the late ‘90s, an archive of licensed Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd. merchandise that spans Takashi Murakami's entire career, and a retrospective of his creations for Louis Vuitton since 2003.</p>

<p>©MURAKAMI presents a selection of the artist’s major works spanning the entire length of his career, beginning with his works from the early 1990s, which launched Japan’s Neo-Pop generation. A significant portion of the exhibition is dedicated to the ongoing evolution of Murakami’s alter ego, DOB, and the figure projects of the late 1990s inspired by the otaku, a Japanese anime and manga obsessed geek subculture.

<p>FUTURISM</p>

<p>One hundred years after the publication in Le Figaro on February 20 1909 of the Futurist Manifesto, signed by the ‘jeune poète italien’ Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the Peggy Guggenheim Collection celebrates this revolutionary avant-garde movement with the exhibition Masterpieces of Futurism at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, curated by Philip Rylands, director of the Venetian museum (from February 18 through 2009). The exhibition also serves as an homage to the foresight of Gianni Mattioli, one of the great collectors of 20th century art, who accumulated a comprehensive presence of Futurism in his collection. This includes works by Giacomo Balla, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Luigi Russolo, Gino Severini, Ottone Rosai, Mario Sironi and Ardengo Soffici.</p>

<p>Masterpieces of Futurism at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection presents key paintings of the movement such as Materia and Dynamism of a Cyclist by Boccioni, Mercury Passing Before the Sun by Balla, The Galleria of Milan by Carrà, Blue Dancer by Severini, three works from Peggy Guggenheim’s collection (Severini’s Sea = Dancer, Balla’s Abstract Speed + Sound, and Boccioni’s sculpture Dynamism of a Speeding Horse + Houses), as well as loans from private collections by Balla, Boccioni, Carrà and Sironi. This will also be the debut of a recent gift to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, Sironi’s early masterpiece The Cyclist (1916). The exhibition includes three of Boccioni’s four extant sculptures: in addition to the mixed media Dynamism of a Speeding Horse + Houses, bronze cast of his celebrated Development of a Bottle in Space and Unique Forms of Continuity in Space.</p>

<p>DORMICE</p>

<p>DORMICE are a pair of artists who together have made fans of Versace, Roberto Cavelli and Leonardo Di Caprio, with their paintings of Supermodels and luxury media inspired imagery. Heinrich Nicolaus was a famous abstract artist in Germany before becoming bored with the ease he could make huge sums of money for his works without a challenge, and so setting off travelling the world lecturing artists on, not how to paint, but how to become a famous artist. In Canada he met Sawan Yawnghwe who was a prodigy in figurative painting. Sawan, with the arrogance of youth and genius muscled his way into Heinrichs large studio and started to produce stunning figurative works, which Heinrich startted addig text to, and the collaboration team was formed.</p>

<p>DORMICE have now painted together in Italy for 11 years. They had Leonardo Da Vinci's old studio in a castle in Tuscany for 5 years, but have recently moved to a gigantic converted church where they make paintings up to 20 feet long which use the images we are constantly bombarded with in fashion and luxury magazines to comment on life.</p>

<p>Currently showing at the Wanted Gallery in Notting Hill, including many never before seen works and an installation by Heinrich Nicolaus.</p>

<p>POSTER GIRL</p>

<p>Electric Blue Gallery plays host to a collection of new works by the hugely influential graphic artist Jasper Goodall. Goodall rose to public attention with his style defining work for The Face magazine in 2000-2003 influencing a generation of illustrators and helping pave the way for illustration's resurgence and reinvention in recent years. <br>Here Goodall presents for the first time, his first solo show of personal work in a gallery environment. Entitled 'Poster Girl' the work explores the notion of fantasy versus reality, a subject which has fascinated Goodall for some time. "Sexual attraction, I believe is almost entirely down to our fantasies, after all when you first meet someone you don't know them, but you make up and idea about them in your mind and it's this fantasy that you are attracted to. Once you get to know them, all too often the fantasy doesn't match with the reality.</p>

<p>Ready for the drop 6th February</p>

<p>ANDREAS GOLDER EDITIONS</p>

<p>On the occasion of the opening of his first exhibition at the gallery, White Cube is pleased to present three new lithograph prints by Berlin-based artist Andreas Golder. Two in black and white, one in colour, Mama and Papa display Golder's ongoing fascination with representations of the human skull and of 'momento mori'. With imagery that alludes to a wide range of sources, from the paintings of Hieronymous Bosch, to the zombie movies of George A Romero, Golder allows them to converge in a contemporary reworking of the grotesque.</p>

<p>KRUNK FUTURA PRINTS</p>

<p>Futura’s recent LA show, Strategic Synchronicity, marked an extraordinary return from one of graffiti’s most influential pioneers: the progression and intricacies of the pieces confirmed the collection as his best work to date - and the sell-out show was greeted with respect and admiration by the art world.
Strategic Synchronicity was produced by curators KRUNK, an international team dedicated to the concept of ‘pop-up’ art shows staged in unique settings, with specially-created multimedia backdrops that use music and film to heighten the viewing experience.
Collectors now have one final chance to own a part of this seminal show: KRUNK has re-created two of the key abstract paintings from the collection in ‘ultimate’ quality print form.<br>
The prints are priced at £525 each, excluding delivery.</p>
