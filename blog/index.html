<p>TIM NOBLE &amp; SUE WEBSTER<br>
PORTRAITS FROM THE BOTTOM UP</p>

<p>Continuing to explore their investigation into self-portraiture Tim Noble &amp; Sue Webster have produced work for Portraits from the Bottom Up including an edition of ten bronze works and a series of unique monoprints.</p>

<p>These sculptures are cast bronzes of the artists nipples and arseholes, wall mounted, to challenge the brain by reflecting the positioning of the eyes and mouth.</p>

<p>‘If they say that necessity is the mother of invention, then the original concept for this obscene series of body part prints was born from just that. During a residency on one of the most beautifully passive and colourful of the Caribbean Islands – we found ourselves banished in order to create. Unfortunately this idyll rendered us impotent and we retracted back into our darkened room and turned to our bodies for inspiration.’ Sue Webster.</p>

<p>3D AND THE ART OF MASSIVE ATTACK</p>

<p>Robert’s artwork  has come to define the iconic style of his band and the book explores  their visual history, presenting both familiar and previously unseen  work, from his influential graffiti and stencil art in the Wild  Bunch-era of the ‘80s to Massive Attack cover designs and paste-ups and  paintings. Also included is work made in collaboration with Nick Knight,  Tom Hingston, Judy Blame and Michael Nash Associates, as well as unseen  photographs documenting Del Naja’s ongoing collaboration with United  Visual Artists. And his recent work with filmmaker Adam Curtis.</p>

<p>The  400-page book also features an in-depth interview with the artist,  where he describes the development of the band’s artwork and record  sleeve designs, as well as offering insight into his processes, and  inspirations.</p>

<p>Del Naja’s background as a graffiti artist has  shaped his evolving aesthetic, as well as a strong ethos of ‘do it  yourself’ creativity. His instincts as an artist were forged in an  atmosphere of spontaneity and innovation - from making flyers to  throwing warehouse parties - and this way of working informed the first  record sleeves he created as 3D.</p>

<p>Inspired by magazine culture  and comics, 3D drew on wide-ranging influences, from New York’s hip-hop  scene and Japanese graphics, Jean-Michel Basquiat’s cultural  juxtapositions to Warhol’s pop imagery, politics and punk.</p>

<p>3D and the art of Massive Attack is available to pre-order now; published October 28th, 2013.</p>

<p>TRANSCENDER FESTIVAL - BARBICAN, LONDON<br>
NICOLAS JAAR PLUS EVIAN CHRIST WITH JOSHUA LIGHT SHOW</p>

<p>There was no doubting (at least in our minds) that Saturday night at the Barbican in East London was the hottest ticket in town. Nicolas Jaar, the New-York based Chilean-American electronic musician two years on from his debut album Space is Only Noise was performing, in collaboration with Joshua Light Show, including some of the original Woodstock-era team and Joshua White himself.</p>

<p>For most of the set, we remained seated. This was a performance that required concentration. Jaar used his voice sparingly, but it was at the points when his vocals cut across the track with smooth, old-school cool, that his music was at its cleverest and most mesmerising. From the middle of a ring of tech, plus vibraphone and – once – piano, he took us from serene to edging on dance in what seemed like one seamless piece of music. But dancing may just have pushed us over to full sensory overload, so intense was the experience.</p>

<p>The visuals felt like neither an accompaniment nor an afterthought, but a chance to get in on another act of creation. The team choreographed the light show live, using lasers, ink and shapes, smeared, flicked and beating across the screen. Describing their offering as ‘psychedelic’ doesn’t quite do them justice, although deep into the set you could find yourself losing track of what was following what – the music or the light.  When Jaar first came to the mike to sing, accompanied by four female (and Londoner) choral voices, whilst red ink bubbled and bloomed high above him, it was almost impossibly beautiful.</p>

<p>Jaar was supported by Evian Christ (pseudonym of the UK producer and artist Joshua Leary), who also benefited from the fantastical visuals. He has previously  worked with Kanye West on Yeezus, and you could recognise some of the intelligent hip-hop sampling. But this was a more unnerving and melancholy sound – with the incredible sound system in the Barbican hall only a further gift.</p>

<p>We finished on a treat: a thirty minute set – unannounced – from Darkside, Jaar’s collaboration with guitarist Dave Harrington, with tracks from their new album, Psychic, out on October 8. Although equally incredible, the extra person didn’t make Jaar’s previous work feel any less layered – testament to his talent as a solo artist.</p>

<p>Jaar was performing as part of the Transcender festival, an annual fixture at the Barbican for the last five years. Evolving out of the Ramadan Nights series, the festival intends to explore “spiritual, devotional and psychedelic music”, including contemporary and traditional, Western and non-Western artists, alongside new collaborations such as this one with Joshua Light Show. When we finally got up and danced for the encore, it did feel something like a religious experience. One thing is certain: someone at the Barbican seriously knows what they’re doing.</p>

<p>JAPANESE CHAZUTSU TEA CADDIES BY KAIKADO</p>

<p>Kaikado is the oldest family owned maker of handmade tin tea caddies in the world, the family began producing their innovative Chazutsu caddy in 1875, using sheets of tin imported from Cornwall. Today four skilled craftsman led by Mr Yagi, Design Director, still make the traditional tin, brass, copper and silver caddies at the family run workshop in Kyoto.</p>

<p>Each caddy is made of two layers of metal, the double wall construction keeps the caddies completely airtight and the contents dry. With daily use the outer metal layer will change in tone and develop a unique patina; colour changes in copper being noticeable within three months and the tin caddy slowly changing colour over three to five years.</p>

<p>There are more than 130 highly skilled processes involved in the production of each caddy, many of which can only be carried out by Mr Yagi and his father. The special airtight feature has remained unchanged for over a century, production is time consuming and the finishing meticulous in its attention to detail.</p>

<p>Margaret Howell has selected three cylindrical caddies, available in tin and copper, as well as a special 200g tin caddy with a boxwood lid handle.</p>

<p>Mr Yagi will be demonstrating some of the processes involved in the making of a traditional Japanese Chazutsu tea caddy at the Margaret Howell Wigmore Street shop on Sunday 29th September.</p>

<p>MARGARET HOWELL X OPEN HOUSE LONDON 2013</p>

<p>Margaret Howell continues to support Open-City, the architectural education charity founded by Victoria Thornton to raise awareness and appreciation of the urban landscape. Open-City actively promotes public engagement and education programmes, encouraging a dialogue about the built environment and urban regeneration projects. Established in 1992, the charity offered the public access to private and public buildings of architectural merit over a single weekend in September, many of the buildings were open to the public for the first time. The initiative was known as Open House Weekend, launched in London and now a global annual event across twenty cities including New York, Buenos Aires, Tel Aviv, Perth, Barcelona, Rome and Helsinki.</p>

<p>Margaret Howell has sponsored Open House London Weekend since 2003, supporting a number of buildings from the post war modernist movement designed by architects Margaret Howell personally admires, buildings have included The Royal Festival Hall, Swiss Cottage Library, Balfron Tower and Span Housing.</p>

<p>For this year’s Open House London Weekend (21 - 22 September) Margaret is supporting Battersea Power Station and encouraging the public to visit the building before the site is handed over to developers at the end of September.</p>

<p>Margaret has produced a series of postcards showing a selection of her favourite Open House buildings, the postcards will be available at Battersea Power Station and other key venues over the weekend. The postcards preview the creative concept for the Margaret Howell 2014 calendar, in which Margaret selects twelve buildings she has personally supported or visited since Open House London Weekend started in 1992. The calendar will be available in October and sold to support the work of Open-City, with all profits from the sale of each calendar being donated to the charity.</p>

<p>HERMES X JAEGER-LECOULTRE ATMOS CLOCK</p>

<p>The relationship between Hermés and Jaeger-LeCoultre dates back nearly a century, when the first Hermés timepieces were supplied with Jaeger movements. In the late ’70s, however, the iconic French fashion house began producing its own time-keeping products, effectively halting a decades-old partnership with the Swiss horologists. It was something of a revelation then, when Jaeger-LeCoultre announced its latest collaborator as none other than Hermés, the result of which is a new iteration of the legendary Atmos Clock. The glassblowing specialists created an air-blown, double-layer glass dome cut to create a dotted exterior, a breathtakingly beautiful shell that allows for a glimpse at the clock’s JLC-caliber 560a Atmos movement. In a limited quantity of 176.</p>

<p>LAMBORGHINI AVENTSDOR LP-700-4 ROADSTER</p>

<p>Lamborghini unveil the roadster version of the Aventador. Its arrival comes just over a year after the introduction of the Aventador Coupe. The Aventador Roadster’s roof is made from solid carbon fiber and relatively simple to put up and take down. Weighing less than 6 kgs (13 lbs) in total, the two roof pieces can be stowed in the front luggage compartment when not in use.</p>

<p>The Roadster’s windows have chamfered edges in order to fit perfectly with the edges of the hard top. Moreover, its bodywork sports a two-tone paint, with the roof and the upper area up to the “fins” finished in gloss black.</p>

<p>The color palette has been increased by the addition of the new “Azzuro Thetis” light blue paint that, according to the company, harks back to the 1968 Miura Roadster. Finally, as far as the exterior is concerned, the Aventador Roadster is fitted with “Dione” forged alloy rims, which weigh 10 kg (22 pounds) less, and measure 20 and 21 inches in diameter front and rear respectively.”</p>

<p>#ADIDASUNDERGROUND: CROOKED TONGUES - DAY 11</p>

<p>Adidas joined forces with frequent collaborators Crooked Tongues to host a night celebrating classic running shoes, the sneaker culture and good music with some free drinks, assuring things were flowing smoothly. The accompanying audio background was provided by London-based music collective Livin’ Proof who offered an eclectic selection of the best of hip-hop sounds in the past twenty years, ranging from DMX, Warren G, A$AP Rocky, Kendrick Lamar, just to name a few. The celebration was a worthy conclusion of a remarkable #adidasundeground’s ambitiously unique event series that celebrated and honored the close cultural relationships between sports, music, fashion, and arts.</p>

<p>#ADIDASUNDERGROUND: THE STONE ROSES - DAY 6</p>

<p>It was a truly memorable night of British rock. Hands down the most epic of the nights thus far at the ongoing #adidasunderground venue in Shoreditch, London, a surprise invite-only concert welcomed iconic Manchester band, The Stone Roses to its stage last night. Maybe it was the fact that frontman Ian Brown and the band were playing to an extremely small crowd of about 600 people that made the event so special. Or perhaps the even more unbelievable part about the show was the fact that it was easily the most intimate crowd the band has entertained in well over a decade.</p>

<p>#ADIDASUNDERGROUND: FACTORY FLOOR LIVE - DAY 5</p>

<p>Continuing with its music-centered modus from the past few nights, #adidasunderground welcomed London-based band, Factory Floor, to its stage last night for a special live performance. The private event ushered in patrons to the expansive space which had been reimagined slightly from the previous nights placing the stage and DJ booth in the center of the room. After opening its doors at around 9:00 p.m., the crowd began to slowly build into a full capacity audience as the 11:30 p.m. headline act took to the stage.</p>

<p>A room that just 30 minutes previous had been characterized perhaps better by, “mood lighting” was rapidly plunged into a wall-to-wall psychedelic visual experiment of pulsating patterns, pixelized shapes and chromatic geometry. Laying into the drums, synthesizers and noise machines, each element played its roll in bringing the sounds to life through the surround sound system-equipped venue.</p>

<p>#ADIDASUNDERGROUND: CHEMICAL BROTHERS - DAY 4</p>

<p>The space played host to an incredibly immersive and fully experiential showing of The Chemical Brothers' DON'T THINK film. The film, which was originally captured in last year at Japan's Fuji Rock Festival, was captured on an intricate amalgam of over 21 camera that were positioned throughout the over 50,000 person crowd. The film's director, Adam Smith, was able to capture the ridiculously "mind-bending" audio-visual live show that is so characteristic of The Chemical Brothers.</p>

<p>For #adidasunderground, the challenge was to take the film, which captures an already intense barrage of lights, sound and music, and augment it in such a way that does the film justice as opposed to detract from the experience. They did just that. Plastered across the sweeping HD screens of the transformed space, the film was paired with a sound system that made you forget that you weren't actually witnessing the events live and an array of lasers and lights that effectively mimicked the live show's timing and sequence.</p>

<p>With over 50 make-up artists on hand, the #adidasunderground team took it a step further by requiring all entrants to paint their faces like clowns to mimic the film's footage.</p>

<p>#ADIDASUNDERGROUND: SAM BLAIR FILM - DAY 2</p>

<p>Centered around the training and story of some of Britain’s Olympic hopefuls, the film captures an element that is perhaps too often underexposed once the four-year summer Olympics roll around and the worldwide television coverage cues up — hardwork. Following the athletes through the various emotion rollercoasters and daily training regimens, Personal Best brings to light the humbling reality of the life of Olympic sprinter hopefuls in the years leading up to what they hope is there 10 seconds of fame.</p>

<p>Perhaps a reflection of his own investment in the project, Personal Best began as a school project for Blair during his time at the National Film and Television School in London. With a strong affinity for documentary filmmaking, Blair was tapped by adidas to extend what began as a 17-minute school project, into a full-length feature - his first feature film.</p>

<p>The crew from adidas have transformed an unassuming warehouse space within the Shoreditch area of London as a means to play host to both locals and travelers looking for a nice change of pace from the other chaos that has hit the city.<br>
While athletes are right at this moment prepping for various games, a unique competition began to take shape last night in Shoreditch, as the #adidasunderground-hosted event kicked off a bout of two-week-long festivities with a little bit of Rollapaluza Roller Racing madness.</p>

<p>Rollapaluza pits two stationary bicyclists together in a head-to-head round to see who is the fastest. With plenty of drinks to go around, music turned up, and no shortage of cycling camaraderie, the first day of #adidasunderground has set a good trajectory for what can be expected from the ongoing events.</p>

Printed in chocolate brown and coppery gold, it bears the date of the show and comes wrapped in a band showing a monochrome Skullstronaut. Screen printed in Factory Road and hand-sewn.<br>
Also available limited edition ‘Skullstronaut’ giclee print and locally sourced chocolate bars, cleverly playing on the outer space theme and packaged like freeze-dried astronaut food.</p>

<p>The legendary brand uses its iconic waffle patterned sole and timeless “Off the Wall” logo for a surprising product, an original case bearing the classic image of the brand. Vans took their iconic waffle patterned sole and fittingly placed it underneath a white “midsole.” They also applied the red Vans Off the Wall tag, a navy foxing stripe around the border of the screen, and they even put a toe bumper to top it off.</p>

Then invite a few dozen brands ’packed with talent, innovation and attitude’ to inhabit the units.

Available today, the Ryan McGinness capsule collection uses Incase products as a vessel for delivering the New York-based artist’s work, with a range that includes a 15” Protective Sleeve, Snap Case for iPhone 4S and Shoulder Bag. Created specifically for Incase, the original artwork featured in the collection is part of a larger body of work entitled Black Holes.</p>

Fender craftsmen have reproduced Cobain’s battle-hardened left-handed Jaguar down to the last unusual detail, including its worn finish, dual humbucking pickups and unique electronics and controls (which were already in place when Kurt acquired the guitar in summer 1991).</p>

Thousands of illustrators have depicted the cast of Star Wars over the years so in a sense what Elliott Quince has done here is nothing new, however, it tends to be the more famous characters that most people choose to draw; the likes of Darth Vader, Chewbacca, C3P0, Luke, Leia, Yoda, and Boba Fett.</p>

<p>What he has decided to do, to make this project different, is to select a bunch of the more random cast members and imagine how bitter they must have been at not making it big, how badly they were treated on set or how cruelly their lives have panned out since the movies were released.</p>

<p>April 19th, at the Shanghai Auto Show, Volvo Cars visualises a masterpiece of 
Scandinavian design, inspired by Chinese philosophy.</p>

<p>Concept Universe is Volvo’s most luxurious creation ever, and the brand’s answer to the 
question: “What is a beautiful car?” With this sculptural and luminary design study, 
Volvo wants to test a possible new design direction for the brand.  "Just like fine luxury goods, 
this design feels handcrafted and durable enough to stand the test of time," says Peter Horbury, 
Vice President Design at Volvo Car Corporation. "We will compete with the best with our unique 
kind of Scandinavian Design. It is unmatched in performance and technology, but without 
superficiality or complication."</p>

<p>19TH CENTURY IVORY VAMPIRE SLAYING KIT</p>

<p>With Halloween baring it's fangs around the corner, what perfect timing for this 
antique ivory vampire killing kit, to come up for auction.<br>Sold earlier in the month for $4,700. Only one of four matching kits known to exist consisting of an ornate ivory-mounted Christian cross integrating a steel, spring-loaded, .41 caliber single-shot percussion pistol, the center mounted with an ebony shield surmounted with a 8-pointed crown, the tips made from tiny semi-precious red stones. <br>A ruby red five-pointed star adorns the center. The vampire pistol is contained in an ivory case, together with steel dagger blade which attaches to the end of the cross, an ivory cleaning rod, ivory powder bottle, and cap and ball supply. 
The entire case is made from fine elephant ivory and each element is engraved with letters representing the contents.</p>

<p>This particular kit was brought back from Germany after WWII by one Sergeant Glen Pendelton who liberated it from a German museum in Berlin.</p>

<p>THE KRINK TOM SACHS MARKER SET</p>

<p>KRINK has worked closely with Tom Sachs to create markers that suited specific needs for his work. Tom uses a lot of different markers in his work and he has strict standards related to flow, durability, and archival quality. He tested a wide variety of Krink products and we formulated inks to meet his specs. <br>The K-12 rollerball is a brand new marker tip that Tom is really excited about, It's unique to the market, and is a Krink / Tom Sachs exclusive. We also formulated a new red "Slow Drip Formula" for our K-66 marker meeting Tom's specific specs. Perfect for NASA logos on any surface. We also have a new barrel design and over cap for the Krink K-70. Tom liked the ink and flow properties so much that he felt no change was needed for this Krink classic.</p>

<p>To complete the set, Tom created a custom "Dock" to hold the markers, taking his trademark "Police Line Do Not Cross" wood and drilling out custom holes for each of the markers to sit in. Each base is equipped with rubber feet, signed on the front, and numbered on the bottom. Limited to 100 pieces.</p>

<p>Michael Leon’s “skull wearing sunglasses” graphic was recently converted into a 3D sculpture with help from the likes of Bob Kronbauer and Mike from Furni. Each skull is hand-engraved, numbered and signed and evokes a sense of ‘memento mori’. Only 100 pieces have been produced in numerous colors and applications.</p>

<p>Tucked away in the woods of Chicago, this four-bed, four-bath is a modernist masterpiece, but might be more well-known for its starring role in the painfully infamous car scene of the feature film "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." Its reprise on the web currently comes from its recent listing on the market for $2.3 million. Two steel-and-glass buildings make up this peaceful palace with the garage celebrating the automobile by showcasing the cars within. Architects A. James Speyer and David Haid built the structures on steel beams, creating a Jetson-like pod above the ground. The home also has stunning panoramic views, with floor-to-ceiling glass walls spanning 5,300 square feet and lending an affect much like Philip Johnson's famed Glass House.</p>

<p>SEX ON FIRE</p>

<p>The Lamborghini Murciélago is one of the most extraordinary super sports cars of all time. Automobili Lamborghini 
has now expanded its model range with a new, exceptionally purist and even more extreme top model – the Murciélago LP 670-4 SuperVeloce is even more 
powerful, lighter and faster than the Murciélago LP 640. The Murciélago LP 670-4 SuperVeloce boasts a power-to-weight ratio of 2.3 kg (5.1 lbs) per hp. This catapults it from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in a breathtaking 3.2 seconds and powers it on to a top speed of around 342 km/h (212 mph). Distinctive design refinements ensure that each of this 350-unit limited edition series conveys its full potential from the very first glance.</p>

<h2>IT'S ALL ABOUT ABSOLUT</h2>

<p>In an Absolut world the party is anywhere especially in the Exit office.
With a history of creating extraordinary products and innovating globally renowned new ways in which to package them, ABSOLUT is now launching a stylish new ‘mini bar’ gift set. <br>
When the white architectonical box unfolds, the inside reveals itself as a portable ‘mini bar’ to be filled with garnish and ice, with a classic ABSOLUT VODKA bottle nesting in the middle – intended to make it easier to create the most stylish party anywhere, we've tried it in the office in various departments and can definitely say the we partied harder and harder at each new desk we took the party too...</p>

<h2>EXIT LOVES PETE</h2>

His sporty physique is a result of a combination of time spent as ski instructor training  and  playing the drums.  He has become a firm favourite for the denim brands Levi's and G-star appearing in shows in NY and Barcelona.  He has currently just finished a great season in Milan walking for brands including Alexander McQueen.</p>
